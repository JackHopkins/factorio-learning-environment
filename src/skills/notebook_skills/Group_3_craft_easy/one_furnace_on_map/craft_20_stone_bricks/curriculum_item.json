        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather resources for the smelting process. Specifically, we need at least 40 stone and 10 coal in our inventory.\n\n2. **Current Inventory**: Our current inventory is empty, so we will need to mine all required resources from scratch.\n\n3. **Resource Gathering Plan**:\n   - First, locate the nearest stone resource patch and mine at least 40 units of stone.\n   - Next, locate the nearest coal resource patch and mine at least 10 units of coal.\n   \n4. **Output Check**: After mining each type of resource, we'll check our inventory to ensure that we've gathered the necessary amounts.\n\n5. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Use `nearest()` function to find positions of stone and coal patches.\n   - Move to these positions using `move_to()`.\n   - Harvest the required quantities with `harvest_resource()`.\n   - Verify by inspecting inventory after each mining operation.\n\nNow let's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed with their respective quantities\nresources_needed = [(Resource.Stone, 40), (Resource.Coal, 10)]\n\n# Iterate over each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource_type, quantity_needed in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to that position\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {position}\")\n    move_to(position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified quantity of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {quantity_needed} of {resource_type}\")\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(position, quantity=quantity_needed)\n    \n    # Inspect inventory to verify if enough has been harvested\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_quantity_in_inventory = current_inventory.get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    assert actual_quantity_in_inventory >= quantity_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}.

This should resolve the AttributeError and allow the script to run correctly.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the code is trying to access the 'value' attribute of a tuple object, which doesn't exist. This suggests that the `resource_type` variable is a tuple instead of an expected Enum or object with a 'value' attribute.\n\nThe error is likely caused by incorrectly accessing the Resource enum. When using enums like Resource.Stone or Resource.Coal, we don't need to access a 'value' attribute.

Defines a list of resources to gather with their required amounts.\n2. Loops through each resource, finds its nearest location, moves to it, and harvests it.\n3. After harvesting, it checks the inventory to ensure we've gathered enough of each resource.\n4. Finally, it performs a last check on the inventory to make sure we have at least the required amount of each resource.\n\nThe key changes are:\n- Using `Resource.Stone` and `Resource.Coal` directly as keys for the inventory dictionary, without trying to access a 'value' attribute.\n- Using assert statements to check if we've gathered enough of each resource, which will raise an exception if we haven't.\n- Printing the final inventory for verification.\n\nThis should resolve the AttributeError and correctly gather the required resources."
