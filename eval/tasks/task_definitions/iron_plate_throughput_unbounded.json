End each program with a send_message() call to confirm your actions. If your program errored out this message will not be sent.\n\nIf you are Agent 1, focus on electric power production (boilers, engines, coal extraction, etc). Make sure to build the power poles to connect Agent 2's factory to your power grid.\nIf you are Agent 2, focus on the iron plate factory (iron ore extraction, furnaces, etc). If Agent 1 is encountering issues, help them before building your factory. If you are waiting on power connection for a few steps, take the initiative and try and connect power poles to your power grid.",
