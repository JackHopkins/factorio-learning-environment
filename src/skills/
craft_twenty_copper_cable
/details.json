  "steps": "To craft 20 copper cables in Factorio, you will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Gather Resources:**\n   - **Copper Plates:** You need copper plates to craft copper cables. Specifically, each copper cable requires 1 copper plate. Therefore, you'll need at least 10 copper plates to make 20 copper cables.\n\n2. **Crafting Process:**\n   - Open your inventory (default key `E`).\n   - In the crafting menu that appears on the right side of your screen, locate the option for \"Copper Cable\" within the intermediate products category.\n   - Click on the Copper Cable icon twice or directly specify a quantity of 20 if you have enough resources.\n\n3. **Automation (Optional):**\n   If you want to automate this process using assembling machines:\n   - **Set up an Assembling Machine:** Place an assembling machine and equip it with a recipe for crafting copper cables.\n     - Access the machine's interface and select \"Copper Cable.\"\n   - **Feed Copper Plates Automatically:**\n     - Use transport belts or inserters to provide the assembling machine with a constant supply of copper plates from furnaces where you've been smelting raw copper ore into plates.\n   \n4. **Collection:**\n   - Once crafted, whether manually or via assembly automation, collect your produced copper cables either from your inventory or directly from chests/inventory associated with assemblers.\n\nBy following these steps, you will efficiently produce 20 copper cables needed for progressing in various technology advancements in Factorio. If you're planning larger scale production later on, consider expanding on automated processes further!",
