{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Chest at position (15.5, -4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest (position 15.5, -4.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Iron Chest at position (19.5, -4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest (position 19.5, -4.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Iron Chest at position (23.5, -4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest (position 23.5, -4.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, -3.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 16.0, -3.0) that is currently working and extracting coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, -3.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 20.0, -3.0) that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (24.0, -3.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 24.0, -3.0) that is currently working and extracting coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (15.5, -5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 15.5, -5.5) waiting for space in destination, with a warning about a blocked transport belt.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (19.5, -5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 19.5, -5.5) waiting for space in destination, with a warning about a blocked transport belt.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (23.5, -5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 23.5, -5.5) waiting for space in destination, with a warning about a blocked transport belt.\n\n### Belt Group\nConsists of:\n- A belt group containing 36 belts, currently working with an inventory of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Blocked Transport Belts\n- Clear the transport belts at the specified positions (e.g., (15.5, -6.5), (19.5, -6.5), (23.5, -6.5)) to allow the burner inserters to function properly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- Verify the positions where entities are expected to be placed or interacted with to ensure they exist before executing actions on them.\n\n### Errors with Unhashable Type in GetEntities\n- Ensure that the input to the GetEntities function is not a list; use appropriate data structures that are hashable.\n\n### Errors with Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Ensure there are sink entities in place to accept the output from inserters to avoid blockage.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Positioned Correctly\n- Check the positioning of inserters to ensure they have access to their drop locations and are not obstructed by other entities."}
