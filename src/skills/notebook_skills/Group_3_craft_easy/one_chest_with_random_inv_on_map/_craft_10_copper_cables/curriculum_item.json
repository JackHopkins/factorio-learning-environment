Smelt copper ore into copper plates\n4. Craft copper cables\n\nWe'll need to use the coal and stone from the chest for crafting the furnace and fueling it. We'll also need to mine additional stone for the furnace if there's not enough in the chest.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Print recipes. We need to craft stone furnace and copper cables. Print out their recipes.\n\nSTEP 2: Gather resources from the chest. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Move to the chest at position (-11.5, -11.5)\n- Take all the coal and stone from the chest\n\nSTEP 3: Mine additional resources. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Mine stone if there's not enough for a furnace\n- Mine copper ore (at least 5)\n\nSTEP 4: Craft stone furnace. We need to craft a stone furnace using the stone we gathered.\n\nSTEP 5: Set up smelting operation. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Place the stone furnace\n- Fuel the furnace with coal\n\nSTEP 6: Smelt copper plates. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Put copper ore into the furnace\n- Wait for the copper ore to smelt into copper plates\n- Collect the copper plates from the furnace\n\nSTEP 7: Craft copper cables. We need to craft 10 copper cables using the 5 copper plates we smelted.\n\nSTEP 8: Verify success. Check the inventory to ensure we have 10 copper cables.\n\n###END OF PLAN",
