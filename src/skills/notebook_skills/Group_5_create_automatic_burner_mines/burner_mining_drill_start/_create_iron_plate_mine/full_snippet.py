Main Objective: We need create an automated iron plate burner mine that mines iron ore to a fueled furnace placed at the drill's drop position that will smelt plates. First place down the drill and then place a furnace at drill's drop position with fuel. The final setup should be checked by looking if the furnace has any iron PLATES in it

"""
Step 1: Place the burner mining drill. We need to find an iron ore patch and place the burner mining drill on it. This step involves:
- Move to the nearest iron ore patch
- Place the burner mining drill on the iron ore patch
- Fuel the burner mining drill with coal

Step 2: Place and fuel the stone furnace. We need to place a stone furnace at the drill's drop position and fuel it. This step involves:
- Identify the drop position of the burner mining drill
- Place a stone furnace at the drill's drop position
- Fuel the stone furnace with coal

Step 3: Verify the setup. We need to check if the automated iron plate production is working correctly. This step involves:
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow time for mining and smelting
- Check the contents of the stone furnace for iron plates
