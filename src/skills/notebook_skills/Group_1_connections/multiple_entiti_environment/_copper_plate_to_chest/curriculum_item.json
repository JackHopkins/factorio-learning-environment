        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `get_entities()` function is returning a list that includes both chests and furnaces. When we try to access the `inventory` attribute of a furnace object, it fails because furnaces don't have an `inventory` attribute in the same way that chests do.\n\nTo fix this, we need to modify our approach:\n1. We should use `get_entities()` with a specific set of prototypes to only get chests.\n2. We need to use the correct method to inspect the contents of entities, which is `inspect_inventory()`.\n3. We should add more error checking and assertions to ensure our operations are successful.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Move to the furnace\nfurnace_position = Position(x=0, y=-5)\nmove_to(furnace_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to furnace at position {furnace_position}\")\n\n# Get the furnace entity\nfurnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)\nassert furnace is not None, f\"Failed to find furnace at {furnace_position}\"\nprint(f\"Found furnace: {furnace}\")\n\n# Place burner inserter next to the furnace's output (south side)\ninserter_position = Position(x=furnace.position.x, y=furnace.position.y + 1)\ninserter = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, Direction.UP, inserter_position)\nassert inserter is not None, f\"Failed to place inserter at {inserter_position}\"\nprint(f\"Placed burner inserter at {inserter_position}\")\n\n# Find the nearby chest with coal\nchests = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest})\ncoal_chest = next((chest for chest in chests if inspect_inventory(chest).get('coal', 0) > 0), None)\n\nif coal_chest:\n    print(f\"Found chest with coal at {coal_chest.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to the chest\n    move_to(coal_chest.position)\n    print(f\"Moved to chest at {coal_chest.position}\")\n    \n    # Extract coal from the chest\n    coal_extracted = extract_item(Prototype.Coal, coal_chest.position, 5)\n    assert coal_extracted > 0, f\"Failed to extract coal from chest at {coal_chest.position}\"\n    print(f\"Extracted {coal_extracted} coal from the chest\")\n    \n    # Move back to the inserter\n    move_to(inserter.position)\n    print(f\"Moved back to inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n    \n    # Insert coal into the inserter\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, 5)\n    print(\"Inserted coal into the inserter\")\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"No chest with coal found nearby\")\n\n# Print final setup\nprint(f\"Furnace setup complete. Furnace at {furnace.position}, Inserter at {inserter.position}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis corrected code addresses the issues in the original attempt:\n1. It uses `get_entities()` with a specific set of prototypes (`{Prototype.WoodenChest}`) to only get chests.\n2. It uses `inspect_inventory()` to check the contents of the chests.\n3. It adds assertions to check if critical operations (like finding the furnace and placing the inserter) are successful.\n4. It raises an exception if no chest with coal is found, which will stop the script and provide a clear error message.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and make the script more robust."
