        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the assertion checking for coal in the chest inserter's inventory fails. This suggests that the coal was not successfully inserted into the chest inserter. The problem likely stems from the way we're interacting with the inserters and managing the coal. Let's analyze the potential issues:\n\n1. We're extracting coal from the chest and then trying to insert it into the inserters. This two-step process might not be necessary or correct.\n\n2. We're not considering that the inserters might automatically pick up fuel from adjacent entities.\n\n3. We're not waiting for the inserters to potentially pick up the coal on their own.\n\n4. We're not checking if the inserters already have coal before trying to insert more.\n\n5. The API might not support direct insertion of items into inserters, and instead, inserters might need to pick up items themselves.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nLet's correct the approach by simplifying the process and letting the inserters pick up coal on their own. We'll also add some waiting time to allow for this process to occur naturally.\n\n```python\nfrom factorio_instance import *\n\n# Move to the chest and place a burner inserter next to it\nchest_position = Position(x=5.5, y=-4.5)\nmove_to(chest_position)\nchest_inserter = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerInserter, chest_position, direction=Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(f\"Placed chest inserter at {chest_inserter.position}\")\n\n# Rotate the chest inserter to take items from the chest\nchest_inserter = rotate_entity(chest_inserter, Direction.LEFT)\nprint(f\"Rotated chest inserter to face {chest_inserter.direction}\")\n\n# Move to the furnace and place a burner inserter next to it\nfurnace_position = Position(x=5.0, y=0.0)\nmove_to(furnace_position)\nfurnace_inserter = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerInserter, furnace_position, direction=Direction.LEFT)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace inserter at {furnace_inserter.position}\")\n\n# Rotate the furnace inserter to put items into the furnace\nfurnace_inserter = rotate_entity(furnace_inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(f\"Rotated furnace inserter to face {furnace_inserter.direction}\")\n\n# Check the contents of the chest\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, chest_position)\nchest_inventory = inspect_inventory(chest)\ncoal_count = chest_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nprint(f\"Coal in chest: {coal_count}\")\n\nif coal_count >= 2:\n    print(\"Waiting for inserters to pick up coal...\")\n    sleep(10)  # Wait for 10 seconds to allow inserters to pick up coal\n\n    # Verify the inserters have coal\n    chest_inserter = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, chest_inserter.position)\n    furnace_inserter = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, furnace_inserter.position)\n    \n    chest_inserter_inventory = inspect_inventory(chest_inserter)\n    furnace_inserter_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_inserter)\n    \n    assert chest_inserter_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0, \"Chest inserter doesn't have coal\"\n    assert furnace_inserter_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0, \"Furnace inserter doesn't have coal\"\n    print(\"Both inserters fueled with coal\")\nelse:\n    raise Exception(f\"Not enough coal in chest.

Removed the manual extraction and insertion of coal.\n2. Added a sleep period to allow inserters to pick up coal on their own.\n3. Re-fetched the inserter entities before checking their inventories to ensure we have the most up-to-date information.\n4. Changed the assertion to check if the coal count is greater than 0, rather than exactly 1, to account for potential variations in pickup behavior.\n\nThese changes should resolve the issue and allow the script to run successfully, verifying that both inserters have picked up coal from the chest."

  "full_plan": "Plan Analysis:\nTo set up coal transport from a chest to a furnace, we need to use the existing entities on the map. We have a chest with coal at position (5.5, -4.5) and three furnaces on the map. We'll choose the closest furnace to the coal chest, which is at position (5.0, 0.0). We need to use burner inserters and transport belts to move the coal from the chest to the furnace. We have all the necessary items in our inventory, so we don't need to craft anything.\n\nThe plan will involve placing burner inserters near the chest and furnace, connecting them with transport belts, and then checking if the furnace is fueled.\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Place inserters. We need to place two burner inserters, one near the chest and one near the furnace. The substeps are:\n- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5) and place a burner inserter next to it\n- Rotate the inserter to take items from the chest\n- Move to the furnace at (5.0, 0.0) and place a burner inserter next to it\n- Rotate the inserter to put items into the furnace\n- Fuel both inserters with coal from the chest\n\nSTEP 2: Connect with transport belts. We need to connect the two inserters using transport belts. The substeps are:\n- Start at the chest inserter's drop position\n- Place transport belts to connect to the furnace inserter's pickup position\n- Ensure the belt direction is correct (from chest to furnace)\n\nSTEP 3: Verify the setup. We need to check if the coal is being transported and the furnace is fueled. The substeps are:\n- Wait for 30 seconds to allow time for coal transport\n- Check if the furnace at (5.0, 0.0) has coal in its fuel inventory\n\n###END OF PLAN",
