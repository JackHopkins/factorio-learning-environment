Main Objective: We need to set up iron plate transport from a furnace to a chest. The final setup should be checked by looking if the chest where we sent plates to has iron plates
"""



"""
Step 1: Place inserters. We need to place two burner inserters: one next to the furnace to extract iron plates, and one next to the chest to insert iron plates.
- Move to the furnace at (0, 5) and place a burner inserter next to it
- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5) and place a burner inserter next to it, then rotate it to face the chest
"""

"""
Step 2: Connect with transport belts. We need to connect the two inserters using transport belts to create a path for the iron plates.
- Start at the furnace inserter's drop position
- Place transport belts to create a path to the chest inserter's pickup position
"""

"""
Step 3: Fuel the inserters. We need to ensure the burner inserters have fuel to operate.
- Move to each inserter and add coal from the chest at (5.5, -4.5) that contains 100 coal
"""
# Placeholder 3

"""
Step 4: Verify the setup. We need to check if the iron plates are being transported successfully.
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow time for the iron plates to be produced and transported
- Check the inventory of the chest at (5.5, -4.5) to see if it contains iron plates
