        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that the `harvest_resource` function does not accept an `amount` keyword argument. This is likely due to a change in the API or a misunderstanding of the function's parameters. Let's analyze the issue:\n\n1. The `harvest_resource` function is being called with an `amount` parameter, which is causing the TypeError.\n2. We need to check the correct syntax for the `harvest_resource` function based on the provided API documentation.\n3. The API documentation shows that `harvest_resource` takes `position`, `quantity`, and `radius` as parameters, not `amount`.\n4. We should replace `amount` with `quantity` in the function call.\n5. We also need to ensure that we're correctly checking the harvested amount, as the function returns the quantity harvested.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define required resources and their quantities\nrequired_resources = [(Resource.Stone, 5), (Resource.IronOre, 4), (Resource.Coal, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each required resource\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in required_resources:\n    # Find the nearest position of this resource type\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    nearest_resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards that position to start harvesting\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {nearest_resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(nearest_resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting the specified amount of resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} units of {resource_type}.\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(nearest_resource_position, quantity=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we successfully harvested enough resources\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    assert current_inventory_count >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}.

Using `Prototype.IronOre.value[0]` to get the correct key for the chest's inventory: `iron_ore_in_chest = chest.inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre.value[0], 0)`\n3. Using `Resource` enum directly in the final assertions: `final_inventory_status.get(Resource.Stone, 0)`\n\nThese changes ensure that we're using the correct keys when accessing inventories, both for the player and for entities like the wooden chest."

We need to implement a more robust waiting and checking mechanism.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's a corrected version of the script that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\n# Step 4 Implementation\n\n# Move to wooden chest and retrieve 20 iron ore\nchest_position = Position(x=-11.5, y=-11.5)\nprint(\"Moving towards wooden chest...\")\nmove_to(chest_position)\n\n# Retrieve iron ore from wooden chest\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=chest_position)\niron_ore_in_chest = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest.position, quantity=20)\nprint(f\"Extracted {iron_ore_in_chest} iron ore from wooden chest.\")\n\n# Move to stone furnace\nfurnace_position = Position(x=-10.0, y=-11.0)\nprint(\"Moving towards stone furnace...\")\nmove_to(furnace_position)\n\n# Get the stone furnace entity\nstone_furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# Insert gathered and existing iron ores into stone furnace\ntotal_iron_ore = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronOre.value[0], 0)\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, target=stone_furnace, quantity=total_iron_ore)\nprint(f\"Inserted {total_iron_ore} units of iron ore into stone furnace.\")\n\n# Add coal as fuel\ncoal_quantity = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Coal.value[0], 0)\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, target=stone_furnace, quantity=coal_quantity)\nprint(f\"Inserted {coal_quantity} units of coal as fuel.\")\n\n# Wait for smelting process to complete\nmax_wait_time = 300  # 5 minutes maximum wait time\nwait_interval = 10  # Check every 10 seconds\ntotal_wait_time = 0\n\nwhile total_wait_time < max_wait_time:\n    sleep(wait_interval)\n    total_wait_time += wait_interval\n    \n    # Check furnace contents\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n    iron_plates_in_furnace = furnace.furnace_result.get(Prototype.IronPlate.value[0], 0)\n    \n    if iron_plates_in_furnace > 0:\n        print(f\"Furnace contains {iron_plates_in_furnace} iron plates.\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Furnace is still smelting...\")\n\n# Extract plates\ntotal_extracted_plates = 0\nmax_extraction_attempts = 5\n\nfor _ in range(max_extraction_attempts):\n    extracted_plates = extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, stone_furnace.position, total_iron_ore - total_extracted_plates)\n    total_extracted_plates += extracted_plates\n    print(f\"Extracted {extracted_plates} iron plates.

It checks the furnace contents directly instead of relying on its status.\n2. It implements multiple extraction attempts with pauses in between to ensure all plates are extracted.\n3. It increases the wait time for smelting the remaining iron ore to ensure the process completes.\n4. It provides more detailed progress messages to help diagnose any issues.\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"No item to extract\" error and ensure that all iron ore is properly smelted into iron plates.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs when trying to extract iron plates from the stone furnace. The error message \"No item to extract\" suggests that there are no iron plates in the furnace when we try to extract them. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The smelting process might not have completed when we try to extract the plates.\n2. We might be trying to extract more plates than what's available in the furnace.\n3. The furnace might not have started smelting at all, possibly due to lack of fuel or iron ore.\n\nLooking at the script, we can see that we're waiting for the smelting process to complete, but we're only checking if there are any plates in the furnace. We're not ensuring that all the iron ore has been smelted before trying to extract.\n\nAdditionally, we're not checking if the furnace has actually started working (i.e., if it has both fuel and iron ore).\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo fix these issues, we need to make the following changes:\n\n1. Check if the furnace is actually working (has fuel and iron ore).\n2. Wait until all iron ore has been smelted before extracting.\n3. Extract only the amount of plates that are actually in the furnace.\n\nHere's the corrected code for the problematic part:\n\n```python\n# Step 4 Implementation\n\n# Move to wooden chest and retrieve 20 iron ore\nchest_position = Position(x=-11.5, y=-11.5)\nprint(\"Moving towards wooden chest...\")\nmove_to(chest_position)\n\n# Retrieve iron ore from wooden chest\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=chest_position)\niron_ore_in_chest = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest.position, quantity=20)\nprint(f\"Extracted {iron_ore_in_chest} iron ore from wooden chest.\")\n\n# Move to stone furnace\nfurnace_position = Position(x=-10.0, y=-11.0)\nprint(\"Moving towards stone furnace...\")\nmove_to(furnace_position)\n\n# Get the stone furnace entity\nstone_furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# Insert gathered and existing iron ores into stone furnace\ntotal_iron_ore = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronOre.value[0], 0)\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, target=stone_furnace, quantity=total_iron_ore)\nprint(f\"Inserted {total_iron_ore} units of iron ore into stone furnace.\")\n\n# Add coal as fuel\ncoal_quantity = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Coal.value[0], 0)\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, target=stone_furnace, quantity=coal_quantity)\nprint(f\"Inserted {coal_quantity} units of coal as fuel.\")\n\n# Wait for smelting process to complete\nmax_wait_time = 300  # 5 minutes maximum wait time\nwait_interval = 10  # Check every 10 seconds\ntotal_wait_time = 0\n\nwhile total_wait_time < max_wait_time:\n    sleep(wait_interval)\n    total_wait_time += wait_interval\n    \n    # Check furnace contents\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n    iron_ore_in_furnace = furnace.furnace_source.get(Prototype.IronOre.value[0], 0)\n    iron_plates_in_furnace = furnace.furnace_result.get(Prototype.IronPlate.value[0], 0)\n    \n    print(f\"Furnace contains {iron_ore_in_furnace} iron ore and {iron_plates_in_furnace} iron plates.\")\n    \n    if iron_ore_in_furnace == 0 and iron_plates_in_furnace > 0:\n        print(\"All iron ore has been smelted.\")\n        break\n    else:\n        print(\"Furnace is still smelting...\")\n\n# Extract plates\ntotal_extracted_plates = 0\nmax_extraction_attempts = 5\n\nfor _ in range(max_extraction_attempts):\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n    iron_plates_in_furnace = furnace.furnace_result.get(Prototype.IronPlate.value[0], 0)\n    \n    if iron_plates_in_furnace > 0:\n        extracted_plates = extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, stone_furnace.position, iron_plates_in_furnace)\n        total_extracted_plates += extracted_plates\n        print(f\"Extracted {extracted_plates} iron plates.

Waiting a bit longer for the smelting process to complete.\n4. Performing multiple extraction attempts with pauses in between.\n\nThese changes should prevent the \"No item to extract\" error and ensure all iron ore is smelted into plates."
