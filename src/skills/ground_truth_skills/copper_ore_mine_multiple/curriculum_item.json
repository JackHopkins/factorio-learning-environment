  "objective": "We need create an automated copper burner mine that mines copper ore to a chest further away from it with 1 burner mining drill. Another burner mining drill will mine copper ore to a furnace and smelt plates. The final setup should be checked by looking if the chest has any copper ore in it.",
  "objective_gen_instructions": "Do not use electric mining drills or assembly machines. Generate setups with 2 mining drills that feed into different chests or a furnaces (multiple drills cannot feed into the same furnace or chest). The outputs need to be further away from the drills (atleast 5 spaces but not over 15)",
