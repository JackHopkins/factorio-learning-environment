        "To achieve the current step, we need to gather resources manually. The goal is to ensure that our inventory contains at least 20 stone, 50 coal, 50 iron ore, and 50 copper ore. We will use the `nearest` function to locate each resource type on the map and then move to these positions to harvest them. After harvesting each resource type, we'll verify that we've gathered enough by inspecting our inventory.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify and move to the nearest position of each required resource: stone, coal, iron ore, and copper ore.\n2. Harvest a sufficient amount of each resource.\n3. Verify that our inventory meets or exceeds the required quantities for each resource.\n\nNow let's implement this in code.\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed with their respective amounts\nresources_needed = {\n    'stone': 20,\n    'coal': 50,\n    'iron-ore': 50,\n    'copper-ore': 50\n}\n\n# Iterate over each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource_name, required_amount in resources_needed.items():\n    # Get the nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_name}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_name)\n    \n    # Move to the location of the resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_name} at position {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting more than needed for buffer (10% extra)\n    harvest_amount = int(required_amount * 1.1)\n    \n    # Harvesting resources from identified position\n    print(f\"Harvesting {harvest_amount} units of {resource_name}...\")\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=harvest_amount)\n    \n    # Check if we have enough resources after harvesting\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    actual_quantity = current_inventory.get(resource_name, 0)\n    \n    assert actual_quantity >= required_amount,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_name}.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `nearest()` function expects a `Prototype` or `Resource` enum value, not a string. In the current implementation, we're passing string keys from the `resources_needed` dictionary directly to the `nearest()` function, which causes the AttributeError.\n\nTo fix this, we need to convert the string resource names to the appropriate `Resource` enum values before passing them to the `nearest()` function. We also need to adjust how we interact with the inventory, as the `Inventory` class uses `Prototype` or `Resource` enum values as keys, not strings.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\nfrom factorio_instance import *\n\n# Define the resources needed with their respective amounts\nresources_needed = {\n    Resource.Stone: 20,\n    Resource.Coal: 50,\n    Resource.IronOre: 50,\n    Resource.CopperOre: 50\n}\n\n# Iterate over each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource, required_amount in resources_needed.items():\n    # Get the nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource.name}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource)\n    \n    # Move to the location of the resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource.name} at position {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting more than needed for buffer (10% extra)\n    harvest_amount = int(required_amount * 1.1)\n    \n    # Harvesting resources from identified position\n    print(f\"Harvesting {harvest_amount} units of {resource.name}...\")\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=harvest_amount)\n    \n    # Check if we have enough resources after harvesting\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    actual_quantity = current_inventory.get(resource, 0)\n    \n    assert actual_quantity >= required_amount,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource.name}.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `Resource` enum is being treated as a tuple instead of an enum.

We'll also need to craft additional tools like a burner mining drill and a burner inserter to automate the process.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the resources and steps needed:\n1. Mine coal for fuel\n2. Mine iron ore and copper ore\n3. Smelt iron plates and copper plates\n4. Craft copper cables\n5. Craft electronic circuits\n\nWe'll need to create a small automated setup to make this process efficient.\n\n###START OF PLAN\n\nSTEP 1: Gather initial resources\n- Mine stone to craft a burner mining drill and additional furnaces\n- Mine coal for fuel\n- Mine iron ore and copper ore manually\nOUTPUT CHECK: Ensure we have at least 20 stone, 50 coal, 50 iron ore, and 50 copper ore in the inventory\n\nSTEP 2: Craft and place initial tools\n- Craft a burner mining drill\n- Craft two additional stone furnaces\n- Place the burner mining drill on a coal patch\n- Place the two new furnaces next to the existing one\nOUTPUT CHECK: Confirm the burner mining drill is placed and working, and three furnaces are available\n\nSTEP 3: Set up smelting operation\n- Fuel all three furnaces with coal\n- Use two furnaces for iron plates and one for copper plates\n- Manually feed iron ore and copper ore into respective furnaces\nOUTPUT CHECK: Ensure all furnaces are working and producing plates\n\nSTEP 4: Craft burner inserters and chests\n- Craft three burner inserters\n- Craft three wooden chests\n- Place inserters and chests next to each furnace to collect smelted plates\nOUTPUT CHECK: Confirm inserters are moving plates from furnaces to chests\n\nSTEP 5: Automate coal mining\n- Craft another burner inserter and wooden chest\n- Place them to automate coal collection from the mining drill\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that coal is being automatically mined and stored\n\nSTEP 6: Craft copper cables\n- Take copper plates from the chest\n- Craft copper cables (2 cables per 1 copper plate)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Ensure we have at least 60 copper cables (for 20 electronic circuits)\n\nSTEP 7: Craft electronic circuits\n- Take iron plates from the chests\n- Craft electronic circuits using 3 copper cables and 1 iron plate each\n- Craft until we have 20 electronic circuits\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have 20 electronic circuits in the inventory\n\n###END OF PLAN",
