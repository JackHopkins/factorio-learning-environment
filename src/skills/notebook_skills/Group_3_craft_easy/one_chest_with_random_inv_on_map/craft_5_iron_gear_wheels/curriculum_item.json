We have already crafted a stone furnace in the previous step and it is available in our inventory. Now, let's break down the steps needed:\n\n1. **Place the Stone Furnace**: We'll place the stone furnace near the wooden chest so that we can easily access resources from it.\n2. **Extract Coal and Iron Ore**: Extract coal and iron ore from the wooden chest to fuel the furnace and provide input for smelting.\n3. **Insert Resources into Furnace**: Insert both coal as fuel and iron ore as material into the stone furnace.\n4. **Wait for Smelting Process**: Allow time for smelting to complete based on how many ores are being processed (approximately 0.7 seconds per unit of iron ore).\n5. **Collect Iron Plates**: Finally, extract the resulting iron plates from the furnace.\n\nLet's write this plan out in code.\n\n```python\n# Step 3: Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n\n# Place stone furnace near wooden chest\nfurnace_position = Position(x=-11.0, y=-12.0)\nprint(f\"Placing stone furnace at {furnace_position}\")\nstone_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# Move to wooden chest to extract resources\nmove_to(wooden_chest_position)\nprint(\"Arrived at wooden chest.\")\n\n# Extract coal from wooden chest\ncoal_quantity = 5  # Take enough coal for smelting process\nextracted_coal_success = extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest_position, coal_quantity)\nassert extracted_coal_success, \"Failed to extract coal from wooden chest.\"\nprint(f\"Extracted {coal_quantity} units of coal.\")\n\n# Extract all available iron ore from wooden chest\niron_ore_quantity = inspect_inventory(entity=stone_furnace).get('iron-ore', 13) \nextracted_iron_ore_success = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, wooden_chest_position, iron_ore_quantity)\nassert extracted_iron_ore_success == True , \"Failed to extract all available iron ore from wooden chest.\"\nprint(f\"Extracted {iron_ore_quantity} units of iron ore.\")\n\n# Insert extracted items into stone furnace\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, stone_furnace, coal_quantity)\nstone_furnace = insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, stone_furnace, iron_ore_quantity)\nprint(f\"Inserted {coal_quantity} units of coal and {iron_ore_quantity} units of iron ore into the furnace.\")\n\n# Wait for smelting process - approximately 0.7 seconds per unit of raw material (iron-ore here)\nsmelt_time_per_unit = 0.7  \ntotal_smelt_time = int(smelt_time_per_unit * max_attempts * (expected_max_attempts))\nsleep(total_smelt_time)\n\nmax_attempts = 5\nfor _ in range(max_attempts):\n    # Attempt extraction until successful or attempts exhausted\n    print(\"Attempting extraction...\")\n    extracted_items_count_before_extraction=inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronPlate]\n    \n    if expected_max_attempts >= initial_expected:\n        break\n    \n    sleep(expected_max_attempts*smelter_sleep_seconds) \n\nif not success:\n   raise ValueError (\"Extraction failed after maximum attempts\")\n\nsuccess=True\n\nif success:\n   print(\"Successfully completed objective!
