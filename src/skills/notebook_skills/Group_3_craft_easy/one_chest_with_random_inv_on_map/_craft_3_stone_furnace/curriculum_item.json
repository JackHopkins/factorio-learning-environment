        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `resource_type` in the loop is a tuple, not an object with a `name` attribute. This is likely due to how the `Resource` enum is defined in the Factorio API. The error suggests that `Resource.Stone` and `Resource.IronOre` are tuples rather than enum members with a `name` attribute.\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust how we reference the resource type when checking the inventory. Instead of using `resource_type.name.lower()`, we should use the first element of the tuple, which is likely the string representation of the resource name.\n\nAdditionally, we should ensure that we're using the correct method to harvest resources and check the inventory.
