We'll use the furnace at position (0, 5) that's processing iron ore and the chest at position (5.5, -4.5) for our setup.\n\nHere's the plan to achieve the objective:\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Place inserters. We need to place two burner inserters: one next to the furnace to extract iron plates, and one next to the chest to insert iron plates.\n- Move to the furnace at (0, 5) and place a burner inserter next to it\n- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5) and place a burner inserter next to it, then rotate it to face the chest\n\nSTEP 2: Connect with transport belts. We need to connect the two inserters using transport belts to create a path for the iron plates.\n- Start at the furnace inserter's drop position\n- Place transport belts to create a path to the chest inserter's pickup position\n\nSTEP 3: Fuel the inserters. We need to ensure the burner inserters have fuel to operate.\n- Move to each inserter and add coal from the chest at (5.5, -4.5) that contains 100 coal\n\nSTEP 4: Verify the setup. We need to check if the iron plates are being transported successfully.\n- Wait for 30 seconds to allow time for the iron plates to be produced and transported\n- Check the inventory of the chest at (5.5, -4.5) to see if it contains iron plates\n###END OF PLAN",
