Main Objective: We need create an automated stone burner mine that mines stone to a chest further away from it. First place down the drill, then the chest, then the inserter and then connect inserter with drill. The final setup should be checked by looking if the chest has any stone in it
"""



"""
Step 1: Place the burner mining drill. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Move to the nearest stone patch
- Place the burner mining drill on the stone patch
- Fuel the burner mining drill with coal

Step 2: Place the wooden chest. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Move to a position further away from the drill (at least 5 tiles)
- Place the wooden chest at this position
"""
# Placeholder 2

"""
Step 3: Place and connect the burner inserter. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Place a burner inserter next to the wooden chest
- Rotate the inserter to face the chest (so it can insert items into the chest)
- Fuel the burner inserter with coal

"""
Step 4: Connect the drill to the inserter. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Place transport belts to connect the drop position of the burner mining drill to the pickup position of the burner inserter
- Ensure the transport belt is oriented correctly to move items from the drill to the inserter
"""

"""
Step 5: Verify the setup. We need to carry out the following substeps:
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow the system to operate
- Check the contents of the wooden chest to see if it contains any stone
