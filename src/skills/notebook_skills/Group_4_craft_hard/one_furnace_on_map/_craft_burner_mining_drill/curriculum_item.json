        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather resources required for crafting a BurnerMiningDrill. This involves mining iron ore and coal.\n   \n2. **Iron Ore Requirement**: \n   - We need at least 18 iron ore to smelt into 9 iron plates (since each plate requires 2 ores).\n   \n3. **Coal Requirement**:\n   - At least 10 units of coal are needed for fueling the furnace.\n\n4. **Steps**:\n   - Locate the nearest iron ore patch, move there, and harvest at least 18 units of iron ore.\n   - Locate the nearest coal patch, move there, and harvest at least 10 units of coal.\n   - After harvesting each resource, check if we have gathered enough by inspecting our inventory.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Ensure that after gathering, we have at least 18 iron ore in our inventory.\n   - Ensure that after gathering, we have at least 10 coal in our inventory.\n\nNow let's implement this plan using the provided API:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources we need to gather with their respective quantities\nresources_needed = [(Resource.IronOre, 18), (Resource.Coal, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource_type, required_quantity in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the location of this resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} located at {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {required_quantity} units of {resource_type}\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, required_quantity)\n    \n    # Check how much was actually harvested by inspecting inventory\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    # Log what we've done so far\n    print(f\"Currently have {current_inventory_count} units of {resource_type} in inventory\")\n    \n    # Assert that we have met or exceeded our target for this resource type\n    assert current_inventory_count >= required_quantity,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}. Expected: {required_quantity}, but got: {current_inventory_count}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that you successfully gather both iron ore and coal as per your requirements before moving on to subsequent steps.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `Resource` enum is being treated as if it has a `value` attribute, which it doesn't. The `Resource` enum is likely defined differently than expected. In the Factorio API, resources are typically represented by their string names directly, not as complex objects with a `value` attribute.\n\nThe line causing the error is trying to access `resource_type.value[0]`, but `resource_type` is already the string representation of the resource (like 'iron-ore' or 'coal').\n\nAdditionally, the script is using `Resource.IronOre` and `Resource.Coal`, which might not be defined in the current API. Instead, we should use the string representations directly.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources we need to gather with their respective quantities\nresources_needed = [(\"iron-ore\", 18), (\"coal\", 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource_type, required_quantity in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the location of this resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} located at {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {required_quantity} units of {resource_type}\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, required_quantity)\n    \n    # Check how much was actually harvested by inspecting inventory\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type, 0)\n    \n    # Log what we've done so far\n    print(f\"Currently have {current_inventory_count} units of {resource_type} in inventory\")\n    \n    # Assert that we have met or exceeded our target for this resource type\n    assert current_inventory_count >= required_quantity,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}. Expected: {required_quantity}, but got: {current_inventory_count}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassert final_inventory.get(\"iron-ore\", 0) >= 18, f\"Not enough iron ore. Expected at least 18, but got {final_inventory.get('iron-ore', 0)}\"\nassert final_inventory.get(\"coal\", 0) >= 10, f\"Not enough coal. Expected at least 10, but got {final_inventory.get('coal', 0)}\"\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory after gathering resources: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis corrected code:\n1. Uses string representations for resources instead of enum values.\n2. Correctly accesses the inventory counts using the string keys.\n3. Adds a final inventory check to ensure we have the required amounts of iron ore and coal.\n4. Prints the final inventory for verification.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the script to run successfully.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `nearest()` function expects a `Prototype` or `Resource` enum value, but we're passing a string (`\"iron-ore\"` and `\"coal\"`). The error message indicates that the string object doesn't have a `value` attribute, which is expected for enum types.\n\nTo fix this, we need to use the correct enum types from the `Resource` class for iron ore and coal. We also need to adjust our inventory checks to use these enum types instead of strings.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\nfrom factorio_instance import *\n\n# Define the resources we need to gather with their respective quantities\nresources_needed = [(Resource.IronOre, 18), (Resource.Coal, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and quantity needed\nfor resource_type, required_quantity in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the location of this resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type.name} located at {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {required_quantity} units of {resource_type.name}\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, required_quantity)\n    \n    # Check how much was actually harvested by inspecting inventory\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory()[resource_type]\n    \n    # Log what we've done so far\n    print(f\"Currently have {current_inventory_count} units of {resource_type.name} in inventory\")\n    \n    # Assert that we have met or exceeded our target for this resource type\n    assert current_inventory_count >= required_quantity,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type.name}.

It also adjusts the inventory checks to use these enum types when accessing the inventory dictionary. This should resolve the error and allow the script to run successfully."
