Burner Inserter (to move ore from drill to furnace)\n\nWe also need to mine coal to fuel the drill, inserter, and furnace. Let's break this down into steps:\n\n###START OF PLAN\n\nSTEP 1: Print recipes. We need to craft a stone furnace, burner mining drill, and burner inserter. Print out the recipes for these items:\n- Stone Furnace\n- Burner Mining Drill\n- Burner Inserter\n\nSTEP 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the following resources by hand:\n- Stone for the furnace\n- Iron ore for crafting and smelting\n- Coal for fuel\n\nSTEP 3: Craft necessary items. Craft the following items:\n- Stone Furnace\n- Burner Mining Drill\n- Burner Inserter\n\nSTEP 4: Set up mining and smelting. We need to set up the mining and smelting process:\n- Place the Burner Mining Drill on an iron ore patch\n- Place the Stone Furnace next to the drill's output\n- Place the Burner Inserter between the drill and the furnace\n- Rotate the Burner Inserter to face the furnace\n- Add coal to the Burner Mining Drill, Burner Inserter, and Stone Furnace\n\nSTEP 5: Start mining and smelting. Allow the setup to run until we have at least 12 iron plates in the furnace output.\n\nSTEP 6: Collect iron plates. Move to the furnace and collect the 12 iron plates into the inventory.\n\nSTEP 7: Verify success. Check the inventory to ensure we have 12 iron plates.\n\n###END OF PLAN",
