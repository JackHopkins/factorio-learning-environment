        "To fill in the placeholder for Step 1, we need to print the recipes for the specified items: Electronic Circuit, Copper Cable, Stone Furnace, and Burner Mining Drill. This involves using the `get_prototype_recipe` function from the Factorio API. We will retrieve and print each recipe one by one.\n\n### PLANNING STAGE\n1. **Electronic Circuit Recipe**: Use `get_prototype_recipe` to fetch the recipe for an electronic circuit.\n2. **Copper Cable Recipe**: Fetch the recipe for copper cable.\n3. **Stone Furnace Recipe**: Fetch the recipe for a stone furnace.\n4. **Burner Mining Drill Recipe**: Fetch the recipe for a burner mining drill.\n5. Print all these recipes with clear labels so that they can be easily identified in logs.\n\nNow let's write out this plan into code:\n\n```python\n# Get and print the recipe for Electronic Circuit\nelectronic_circuit_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit)\nprint(\"Recipe for Electronic Circuit:\", electronic_circuit_recipe)\n\n# Get and print the recipe for Copper Cable\ncopper_cable_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperCable)\nprint(\"Recipe for Copper Cable:\", copper_cable_recipe)\n\n# Get and print the recipe for Stone Furnace\nstone_furnace_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Recipe for Stone Furnace:\", stone_furnace_recipe)\n\n# Get and print the recipe for Burner Mining Drill\nburner_mining_drill_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nprint(\"Recipe for Burner Mining Drill:\", burner_mining_drill_recipe)\n\n# After printing all recipes, log success message\nprint(\"Successfully printed all required recipes.\")\n```\n\nThis script retrieves and prints each of the required item recipes step-by-step while providing clear logging messages to ensure traceability through console outputs."

      "full_script_tries": [
        "To gather the required resources, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Stone for Stone Furnace**: According to the recipe, we need 5 stones for crafting a stone furnace. We will harvest more than needed, say 7 stones, to ensure we have enough.\n\n2. **Coal for Fuel**: Coal is needed as fuel for both smelting and operating the burner mining drill. Let's collect at least 10 pieces of coal.\n\n3. **Copper Ore**: Copper ore is necessary for smelting into copper plates, which are then used in crafting copper cables. We'll aim to mine around 15 pieces of copper ore to ensure we have enough after processing losses.\n\nGiven that our inventory is empty and there's no existing setup besides a chest with iron ore, we'll proceed by moving towards each resource location and harvesting them accordingly.\n\nLet's implement these steps in code:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed along with their quantities\nresources_to_gather = [\n    (Resource.Stone, 7),   # Gathering extra stone beyond what's required\n    (Resource.Coal, 10),   # Sufficient coal for multiple uses\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 15) # Extra copper ore considering inefficiencies\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and gather them\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in resources_to_gather:\n    print(f\"Preparing to gather {amount_needed} units of {resource_type}.\")\n    \n    # Find the nearest position of this resource type on the map\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the position where this resource can be harvested\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified quantity of this resource from its position\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Verify that we've collected at least what was planned or more.\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    assert current_inventory_count >= amount_needed, (\n        f\"Failed to gather sufficient {resource_type}. Collected {current_inventory_count}, expected at least {amount_needed}.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered {harvested_amount} units of {resource_type}. Current inventory count: {current_inventory_count}\")\n\n# Print final inventory state after gathering all resources.\nfinal_inventory_state = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Final inventory state after gathering:\", final_inventory_state)\n\n# If all assertions pass without error, indicate success in gathering resources.\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis script methodically gathers each type of required material while ensuring it collects slightly more than strictly necessary due to potential inefficiencies during processes like smelting or crafting later stages. The use of asserts ensures any shortfall is quickly identified during execution.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that the `harvest_resource` function does not accept an `amount` keyword argument. This is likely due to a change in the API or a misunderstanding of the function's parameters. \n\nThe error occurs on the line:\n```python\nharvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount=amount_needed)\n```\n\nThe `harvest_resource` function seems to expect the quantity as a positional argument, not as a keyword argument named 'amount'.\n\nAdditionally, we should consider that the `Resource` enum might not be the correct way to reference resources in this API. We should use `Prototype` instead, as it's used in other parts of the API for referencing game entities.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed along with their quantities\nresources_to_gather = [\n    (Prototype.Stone, 7),   # Gathering extra stone beyond what's required\n    (Prototype.Coal, 10),   # Sufficient coal for multiple uses\n    (Prototype.CopperOre, 15) # Extra copper ore considering inefficiencies\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and gather them\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in resources_to_gather:\n    print(f\"Preparing to gather {amount_needed} units of {resource_type.value[0]}.\")\n    \n    # Find the nearest position of this resource type on the map\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the position where this resource can be harvested\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified quantity of this resource from its position\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    # Verify that we've collected at least what was planned or more.\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    assert current_inventory_count >= amount_needed, (\n        f\"Failed to gather sufficient {resource_type.value[0]}. Collected {current_inventory_count}, expected at least {amount_needed}.\"\n    )\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered {harvested_amount} units of {resource_type.value[0]}. Current inventory count: {current_inventory_count}\")\n\n# Print final inventory state after gathering all resources.\nfinal_inventory_state = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Final inventory state after gathering:\", final_inventory_state)\n\n# If all assertions pass without error, indicate success in gathering resources.\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis corrected version makes the following changes:\n1. Changed `Resource` enum to `Prototype` to match the API's expectations.\n2. Removed the `amount` keyword argument from `harvest_resource` and passed it as a positional argument instead.\n3. Updated the string formatting to use `resource_type.value[0]` to get the string name of the resource.\n\nThese changes should resolve the TypeError and allow the script to run successfully.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that the `harvest_resource` function does not accept a keyword argument 'amount'. This suggests that the function signature has changed or the API documentation is outdated. \n\nThe correct usage of `harvest_resource` function, based on the error and the API documentation provided, should be:\n\n```python\nharvest_resource(position: Position, quantity=1, radius=20) -> int\n```\n\nSo, we need to change our code to use 'quantity' instead of 'amount', and ensure we're passing a Position object for the resource location.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# List of resources we need to gather\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.Stone, 5),  # 5 stone for crafting a stone furnace\n    (Resource.Coal, 10),  # 10 coal for fuel (adjust as needed)\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 15)  # 15 copper ore for smelting (adjust as needed)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource and harvest it\nfor resource, amount_needed in resources_needed:\n    resource_position = nearest(resource)\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we harvested the correct amount\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_amount = inventory.get(resource, 0)\n    assert actual_amount >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to harvest enough {resource}. Expected {amount_needed}, but got {actual_amount}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully harvested {actual_amount} {resource}\")\n\n# Print final inventory after gathering all resources\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after gathering resources: {final_inventory}\")\n\n# Check if we have all the resources we need\nassert final_inventory.get(Resource.Stone, 0) >= 5, \"Not enough stone gathered\"\nassert final_inventory.get(Resource.Coal, 0) >= 10, \"Not enough coal gathered\"\nassert final_inventory.get(Resource.CopperOre, 0) >= 15, \"Not enough copper ore gathered\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all required resources\")\n```\n\nThis code corrects the error by using the correct parameter name 'quantity' instead of 'amount'. It also includes proper error checking and inventory inspection to ensure we've gathered the correct amounts of resources."
