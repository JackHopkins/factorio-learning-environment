[2024-10-28 20:56:22]   - test_create_offshore_pump_to_steam_engine: Tests the placement and connection of a basic power generation system by placing and configuring an offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verifies correct entity positioning, rotation, pipe connections, and initial power network status. The test ensures the components are properly aligned and connected but intentionally leaves the steam engine disconnected from a power network.
[2024-10-28 20:56:22]   - test_auto_fueling_iron_smelting_factory: Tests construction and operation of an automated iron smelting factory setup by verifying that coal mining, iron ore mining, fuel transport, smelting, and storage systems work together to successfully produce iron plates. Ensures all components (drills, belts, inserters, furnace, chest) are properly placed and connected, with final validation that the system produces iron plates over a 60-second runtime.
