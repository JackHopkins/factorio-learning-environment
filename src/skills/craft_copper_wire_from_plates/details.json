  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nCraft 20 copper wire using copper plates in your inventory.\n\nThis objective is different from the examples provided, focuses on a single task, and introduces the player to basic crafting using copper, which is an essential resource in Factorio.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting 20 copper wire using copper plates in your inventory in Factorio, I would suggest the following plan:\n\n1. Ensure you have enough copper plates in your inventory:\n   - Each copper wire requires 0.5 copper plates to craft.\n   - For 20 copper wire, you'll need at least 10 copper plates.\n   - If you don't have enough, mine some copper ore and smelt it into plates first.\n\n2. Open your crafting menu:\n   - Press 'E' to open your inventory and crafting interface.\n\n3. Locate the copper wire recipe:\n   - In the crafting menu, find the icon for copper wire.\n   - It should show that 1 copper plate creates 2 copper wire.\n\n4. Begin crafting:\n   - Left-click on the copper wire recipe to queue up one craft.\n   - You can also right-click to queue up multiple crafts at once.\n   - Queue up 10 crafts of copper wire (or click the recipe 10 times).\n\n5. Wait for crafting to complete:\n   - The crafting will happen automatically as long as you have the required materials.\n   - You'll see the copper wire appear in your inventory as they're crafted.\n\n6. Verify completion:\n   - Check your inventory to confirm you now have at least 20 copper wire.\n\n7. Optional: Set up automation for future wire production:\n   - While not required for this specific objective, you could consider setting up an assembling machine to automate copper wire production for future use.\n\nThis plan introduces the player to the basic crafting mechanics in Factorio, specifically using copper plates to create copper wire, which is indeed an essential resource for many recipes in the game.",
