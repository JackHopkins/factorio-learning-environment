        "To achieve the current step of gathering 5 stone, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Identify the nearest stone patch.\n2. Move to that location.\n3. Mine at least 5 stones by hand from the identified location.\n\nLet's proceed with implementing this plan in code.\n\nPLANNING STAGE:\n- First, we need to locate the nearest stone resource patch using the `nearest` function for resources.\n- Once we have determined the position of the nearest stone patch, we'll move our player character to that position using `move_to`.\n- Then, we'll mine a bit more than needed (e.g., 6 stones) from this location using `harvest_resource`. This ensures that even if there are inefficiencies or losses during mining, we still gather enough stone.\n\nNow let's implement this in Python code.\n\n```python\n# Locate the nearest stone resource patch\nstone_patch_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Nearest stone patch located at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Move to the nearest stone resource patch\nmove_to(stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to position: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Harvest 6 units of stone by hand (a little more than required for safety)\nstones_needed = 6\nharvested_stones = harvest_resource(stone_patch_position, quantity=stones_needed)\nprint(f\"Harvested {harvested_stones} stones\")\n\n# Verify that we've harvested at least 5 stones\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassert current_inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace.value[0], 0) >= 5, \"Failed to gather enough stones!\"\nprint(\"Successfully gathered sufficient amount of stones.\")\n```\n\nThis script will ensure you have mined and collected at least five units of stone as required for crafting a furnace in subsequent steps.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the assertion is checking for the wrong item in the inventory. The code is looking for StoneFurnace in the inventory, but at this stage, we have only mined stone, not crafted a furnace yet. We need to check for the presence of stone (Resource.Stone) instead of StoneFurnace.\n\nAdditionally, the assertion is using Prototype.StoneFurnace.value[0], which is incorrect for checking raw resources. We should use Resource.Stone directly.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Locate the nearest stone resource patch\nstone_patch_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Nearest stone patch located at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Move to the nearest stone resource patch\nmove_to(stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to position: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Harvest 6 units of stone by hand (a little more than required for safety)\nstones_needed = 6\nharvested_stones = harvest_resource(stone_patch_position, quantity=stones_needed)\nprint(f\"Harvested {harvested_stones} stones\")\n\n# Verify that we've harvested at least 5 stones\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassert current_inventory.get(Resource.Stone, 0) >= 5, \"Failed to gather enough stones!\"\nprint(\"Successfully gathered sufficient amount of stones.\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis corrected code will properly check for the presence of stone in the inventory after mining, rather than looking for a stone furnace. The assertion now correctly uses Resource.Stone to check the inventory. I've also added a print statement at the end to show the current inventory for verification."
