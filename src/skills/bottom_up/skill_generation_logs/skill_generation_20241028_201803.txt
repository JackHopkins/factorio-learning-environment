[2024-10-28 20:18:03]   - test_build_auto_refilling_coal_system: Tests construction of an automated coal mining system in Factorio. Verifies placement of burner mining drills, inserters, chests, and transport belts to create a self-sustaining coal extraction setup. The system includes multiple drills connected by a belt network that automatically distributes coal to power the drills and inserters, creating a closed-loop mining operation.
[2024-10-28 20:18:03] Combined inventory requirements: {'stone-furnace': 1, 'iron-chest': 3, 'burner-inserter': 6, 'coal': 50, 'transport-belt': 50, 'burner-mining-drill': 5}
[2024-10-28 20:18:05] Generated objective: Implement a snippet that creates an automated iron ore processing line in Factorio, combining burner mining drills for iron ore extraction with stone furnaces for smelting. The system should use inserters and transport belts to move ore from mines to furnaces, and output iron plates onto a main belt. Include coal distribution to power both the drills and furnaces, ensuring the entire production line operates continuously without manual intervention.
