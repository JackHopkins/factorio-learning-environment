        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script is unable to confirm that the electric mining drill is placed on a copper ore patch. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The `nearest(Resource.CopperOre)` function might not be returning a valid copper ore position. It's possible that there's no copper ore within the search radius.\n\n2. The `place_entity()` function might be placing the drill slightly off from the exact copper ore position due to placement constraints.\n\n3. The `inspect_entities()` function might not be capturing the copper ore entity in its results, possibly due to a small inspection radius or because the drill is covering the ore.\n\nTo address these issues, we need to:\n1. Verify that we can actually find a copper ore patch.\n2. Ensure that we're placing the drill correctly on the copper ore.\n3.

It asserts that a copper ore position is found before proceeding.\n2. It uses a larger radius when inspecting entities around the drill.\n3. It checks for the presence of any copper ore entities near the drill, rather than expecting them to be at the exact same position.\n4.

We should first scan for copper ore in a larger area around the player.\n2. Once we find copper ore, we should move closer to ensure accurate placement.\n3.

Verify that the electric mining drill is powered\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Place electric mining drill. We need to locate a copper patch and place the electric mining drill on it.\n\nSTEP 2: Connect power to electric mining drill. We need to connect the electric mining drill to the steam engine using small electric poles. This involves the following substeps:\n- Place small electric poles starting from the steam engine\n- Continue placing poles towards the electric mining drill\n- Ensure the last pole is within range of the electric mining drill\n\nSTEP 3: Verify power connection. We need to check if the electric mining drill is powered by examining its status.\n- Wait for a few seconds to allow the power to propagate\n- Check the status of the electric mining drill to confirm it has power\n\n###END OF PLAN",
