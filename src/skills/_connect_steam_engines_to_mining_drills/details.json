  "objective": "Create a small electric network by connecting 3 steam engines to 2 electric mining drills",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of creating a small electric network by connecting 3 steam engines to 2 electric mining drills in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine iron ore and coal\n   - Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n   - Craft necessary components (gears, pipes, etc.)\n\n2. Build a water pump near a body of water\n\n3. Place 3 boilers in a line, connected to the water pump with pipes\n\n4. Place 3 steam engines, each connected to a boiler\n\n5. Create a coal mining operation:\n   - Place a burner mining drill on a coal patch\n   - Use inserters to feed coal directly into the boilers\n\n6. Set up the electric network:\n   - Craft and place wooden poles to connect the steam engines\n   - Extend the electric network to the area where you want to place the electric mining drills\n\n7. Place 2 electric mining drills on an ore patch (iron or copper)\n\n8. Connect the electric mining drills to the power network using more wooden poles\n\n9. Use inserters and chests (optional) to collect the mined ore from the electric drills\n\nThis setup will create a small, self-sustaining electric network powered by steam engines and fueled by coal, which in turn powers two electric mining drills for resource gathering.",
