      "full_script_tries": [
        "**PLANNING STAGE**\n\nTo gather the necessary resources, we need to:\n1. Mine copper ore: We need at least 2 copper ore to smelt into copper plates.\n2. Gather wood: We require at least 2 wood for crafting small electric poles.\n3. Mine coal: At least 5 coal is needed to fuel the furnace for smelting operations.\n4. Mine stone: At least 5 stone is required to craft a stone furnace.\n\nGiven that our inventory is currently empty and there are no mining setups except for a wooden chest containing some stone, we'll have to manually collect each resource by moving near its location and using the `harvest_resource` command.\n\nWe will ensure we gather slightly more than the minimum requirements where applicable to account for any possible inefficiencies or errors during execution.\n\n**GAME API USAGE PLAN**\n- Use `nearest(ResourceType)` to find locations of resources (copper ore, wood, coal, and stone).\n- Move to these positions using `move_to(Position)`.\n- Harvest each resource using `harvest_resource(Position, amount)` until we reach the desired quantities.\n- After harvesting each type of resource, use assertions to ensure we've gathered enough before proceeding.\n\nNow let's write the code:\n\n```python\n# Define required amounts of resources\nresources_needed = {\n    'copper_ore': 3,\n    'wood': 3,\n    'coal': 6,\n    'stone': 5\n}\n\n# Function to harvest a specific resource\ndef harvest_specific_resource(resource_type, amount):\n    print(f\"Gathering {resource_type}...\")\n    \n    # Find nearest position of the given resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards the resource position\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest specified amount of this resource type\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount)\n    \n    # Assert if enough was harvested\n    assert harvested_amount >= amount, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `get_entity()` function requires two arguments: the entity prototype and its position. In the current implementation, only the prototype is provided, leading to the TypeError.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few other improvements we can make:\n1. We should use `get_entities()` instead of `get_entity()` as recommended in the specifications.\n2. We don't need to check the chest contents for stone, as we can simply mine the required amount of stone directly.\n3. We should use the `Prototype` enum for resources instead of `Resource`.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Define required amounts of resources\nresources_needed = {\n    Prototype.CopperOre: 3,\n    Prototype.Wood: 3,\n    Prototype.Coal: 6,\n    Prototype.Stone: 5\n}\n\n# Function to harvest a specific resource\ndef harvest_specific_resource(resource_type, amount):\n    print(f\"Gathering {resource_type.value[0]}...\")\n    \n    # Find nearest position of the given resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards the resource position\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest specified amount of this resource type\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount)\n    \n    # Assert if enough was harvested\n    assert harvested_amount >= amount, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type.value[0]}.

It uses the correct function calls, eliminates the unnecessary chest check, and uses the `Prototype` enum for resources. The code also includes additional assertions to verify that all required resources have been gathered successfully.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that there is an AttributeError for 'Wood'. This suggests that 'Wood' is not a valid attribute or enum value of the Prototype class. The error occurs in the line where we're defining the resources_needed dictionary.\n\nThe issue is likely because wood is not considered a prototype in the game's API, but rather a resource. We need to adjust our approach to handle wood differently from the other resources.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo fix this issue, we need to separate wood from the other resources and handle it differently. We'll use Resource.Wood instead of Prototype.Wood for gathering wood.

It should now run without the AttributeError we encountered before.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that there's an issue with accessing the 'name' attribute of a tuple object. This suggests that the `Resource` enum is not being used correctly in the script. The error occurs when trying to print the resource type name in the `harvest_specific_resource` function.\n\nThe issue likely stems from how the `resources_needed` dictionary is defined. It seems that the `Resource` enum is not being used correctly as the key in this dictionary. Instead of `Resource.CopperOre`, it's possible that the script is using a tuple representation of the resource, which doesn't have a `name` attribute.\n\nTo fix this, we need to ensure that we're using the `Resource` enum correctly throughout the script, especially when defining the `resources_needed` dictionary and when accessing resource properties.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected version of the script:\n\n```python\n# Define required amounts of resources\nresources_needed = {\n    Resource.CopperOre: 3,\n    Resource.Coal: 6,\n    Resource.Stone: 5,\n    Resource.Wood: 3  # Include wood in the main dictionary\n}\n\n# Function to harvest a specific resource\ndef harvest_specific_resource(resource_type, amount):\n    print(f\"Gathering {resource_type}...\")\n    \n    # Find nearest position of the given resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards the resource position\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest specified amount of this resource type\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount)\n    \n    # Assert if enough was harvested\n    assert harvested_amount >= amount, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}.

Expected at least {amount}, but got {inventory[resource]}\"\n\nprint(\"All resources verified successfully.\")\n```\n\nThis corrected version makes the following changes:\n\n1. Includes wood in the main `resources_needed` dictionary instead of handling it separately.\n2. Removes the `.name` attribute access when printing resource types, as the `Resource` enum itself can be used directly in string formatting.\n3. Simplifies the script by removing the separate wood handling, treating it like other resources.\n4. Uses the `Resource` enum directly in all places where resource types are referenced.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the script to run successfully, gathering all the required resources including wood, copper ore, coal, and stone."

We also need to gather wood.\n\nGiven that there's a wooden chest on the map containing 2 stone, we can use this chest to store our crafted items. However, we need to gather all other resources.\n\nHere's the plan to achieve the objective:\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Print recipes. We need to print the recipes for small electric poles and copper cables.\n\nSTEP 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the following resources:\n- Mine copper ore (at least 2 copper ore for 2 copper plates)\n- Gather wood (at least 2 wood)\n- Mine coal for fuel (at least 5 coal)\n- Mine stone for a furnace (at least 5 stone)\n\nSTEP 3: Craft and place furnace. We need to craft a stone furnace and place it down:\n- Craft a stone furnace using 5 stone\n- Move to a suitable location and place the stone furnace\n- Fuel the furnace with coal\n\nSTEP 4: Smelt copper plates. We need to smelt copper ore into copper plates:\n- Put copper ore into the furnace\n- Wait for the copper plates to be produced\n- Collect the copper plates from the furnace\n\nSTEP 5: Craft copper cables. We need to craft copper cables:\n- Craft 4 copper cables using 2 copper plates (each craft produces 2 cables)\n\nSTEP 6: Craft small electric poles. We need to craft the small electric poles:\n- Craft 4 small electric poles using 4 copper cables and 2 wood\n\nSTEP 7: Store crafted items. We need to store the crafted small electric poles in the existing chest:\n- Move to the wooden chest at position (-11.5, -11.5)\n- Put the 4 small electric poles into the chest\n\nSTEP 8: Verify success. We need to check if the small electric poles are in the inventory:\n- Check the contents of the wooden chest for 4 small electric poles\n###END OF PLAN",
