        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to mine resources for crafting a GunTurret. Specifically, we need 50 coal, 50 iron ore, and 20 copper ore.\n\n2. **Resources Required**:\n   - Coal: Used as fuel for the furnace.\n   - Iron Ore: To be smelted into iron plates.\n   - Copper Ore: To be smelted into copper plates.\n\n3. **Steps**:\n   - For each resource type (coal, iron ore, copper ore), locate the nearest patch using `nearest(resource)`.\n   - Move to the location of each resource using `move_to(position)`.\n   - Harvest the required amount of each resource using `harvest_resource(position, quantity)`.\n   \n4. **Output Check**:\n   - After mining each resource type, verify that the inventory contains at least the required amount by inspecting it with `inspect_inventory()` and asserting the quantities.\n\n5. **Considerations**:\n    - Ensure you have mined slightly more than needed in case of inefficiencies or losses during processing.\n\nNow let's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Define resources and their required amounts\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.Coal, 50),\n    (Resource.IronOre, 50),\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 20)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and mine them\nfor resource_type, required_amount in resources_needed:\n    # Find nearest position of current resource type\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to that position\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {position}...\")\n    move_to(position)\n    \n    # Harvest the necessary amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {required_amount} units of {resource_type}...\")\n    harvest_resource(position=position, quantity=required_amount)\n\n# Verify if we have mined enough resources by checking inventory\ninventory_after_mining = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Inventory after mining:\", inventory_after_mining)\n\n# Assert checks for verifying correct amounts are present in inventory\nassert inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.Coal.value[0], 0) >= 50,\\\n       f\"Expected at least 50 coal but found {inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.Coal.value[0], 0)}\"\nassert inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.IronOre.value[0], 0) >= 50,\\\n       f\"Expected at least 50 iron ore but found {inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.IronOre.value[0], 0)}\"\nassert inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.CopperOre.value[0], 0) >= 20,\\\n       f\"Expected at least 20 copper ore but found {inventory_after_mining.get(Resource.CopperOre.value[0], 0)}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully mined all required resources.\")\n```\n\nThis script will ensure that we gather all necessary raw materials before proceeding to further steps like smelting or crafting components for our main objective.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script is trying to access a 'value' attribute of the Resource enum, which doesn't exist. The Resource enum is likely defined differently than expected. The correct way to access the name of the resource is to use the enum directly, without trying to access a 'value' attribute.\n\nAdditionally, the script is using Resource enums for harvesting, but the inventory uses Prototype enums for checking the quantities. This inconsistency needs to be addressed.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Define resources and their required amounts\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.Coal, Prototype.Coal, 50),\n    (Resource.IronOre, Prototype.IronOre, 50),\n    (Resource.CopperOre, Prototype.CopperOre, 20)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and mine them\nfor resource, prototype, required_amount in resources_needed:\n    # Find nearest position of current resource type\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource}...\")\n    position = nearest(resource)\n    \n    # Move to that position\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource} at position {position}...\")\n    move_to(position)\n    \n    # Harvest the necessary amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {required_amount} units of {resource}...\")\n    harvested = harvest_resource(position=position, quantity=required_amount)\n    assert harvested >= required_amount, f\"Failed to harvest enough {resource}.

It no longer tries to access a 'value' attribute of the Resource enum.\n2. It uses the correct Prototype enum for inventory checks.\n3. It adds an assertion after each harvest to ensure the correct amount was mined.\n4. It simplifies the final inventory check loop to be more concise and less error-prone.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and make the script more robust in checking that the required resources have been mined successfully."

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs when trying to insert copper ore into the stone furnace. The error message suggests that the insertion failed, which could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The furnace might already be full of iron ore from the previous smelting operation.\n2. The furnace might not have enough space for the copper ore.\n3. The furnace might be in a state where it cannot accept new items (e.g., still processing iron ore).\n\nAdditionally, the script doesn't check if the iron ore smelting was successful before moving on to copper ore smelting. It's also not considering the furnace's capacity or checking its current contents before inserting new materials.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to:\n1. Check the furnace's contents and status before inserting new materials.\n2. Ensure the furnace is empty or has space before inserting new ore.\n3.
