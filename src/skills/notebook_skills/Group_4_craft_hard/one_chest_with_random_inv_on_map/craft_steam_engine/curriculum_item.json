        "**PLANNING STAGE**\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather enough resources to craft a Steam Engine, including its intermediate components like Iron Gear Wheel and Pipe. The recipes have been printed, so we know the exact requirements.\n\n2. **Resource Requirements**:\n   - 31 iron ore (for iron plates)\n   - At least 31 coal (to smelt the iron ore into plates)\n   - 5 stone (to craft a stone furnace)\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Use the `nearest` function to locate resource patches for iron ore, coal, and stone.\n   - Move to each resource patch using the `move_to` function.\n   - Harvest required quantities using the `harvest_resource` function.\n   - Verify that we have gathered at least the minimum required amount of each resource by checking our inventory after harvesting.\n\n4. **Inventory Check**:\n   - After gathering resources, use assertions to ensure that we have collected at least 31 iron ore, 31 coal, and 5 stone.\n\nNow let's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Define required resources with their respective amounts\nrequired_resources = [\n    (Resource.IronOre, 35), # slightly more than needed for safety margin\n    (Resource.Coal, 35),    # slightly more than needed for safety margin\n    (Resource.Stone, 10)    # slightly more than needed for crafting furnace\n]\n\n# Loop through each type of resource required\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in required_resources:\n    \n    # Find nearest position of the current resource type on map\n    nearest_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    print(f\"Nearest {resource_type} found at position: {nearest_position}\")\n    \n    # Move player character to location of nearest resource patch\n    move_to(nearest_position)\n    \n    print(f\"Moved to {resource_type} patch.\")\n\n    # Harvest specified quantity from located resource patch \n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(nearest_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    print(f\"Harvested {harvested_amount} units of {resource_type}.\")\n    \n    # Get updated inventory details post-harvesting operation \n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n\t# Log current state of player's inventory after harvesting operations are completed successfully  \n\tprint(f\"Current Inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n\t# Ensure sufficient quantity is present in player's personal storage/inventory space as expected  \n\tassert current_inventory[resource_type] >= amount_needed,\\\n        f\"Insufficient {resource_type}: Expected at least {amount_needed}, but got only {current_inventory[resource_type]}.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nIn this implementation:\n- We're mining a bit more than strictly necessary (`35 instead of just `31`) due to potential inefficiencies or losses during subsequent steps.\n- We log every action taken along with relevant data points such as positions moved towards or quantities harvested etc., which helps track progress effectively while debugging if any issues arise later down line!\n- Assertions verify successful completion ensuring enough materials were indeed acquired before proceeding further stages within overall task flow!",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that there is an inconsistency in the use of tabs and spaces for indentation on line 31 of the script. This is a common Python syntax error that occurs when mixing tabs and spaces for indentation. Python is very strict about indentation, and mixing tabs and spaces can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\nThe problematic area seems to be in the last part of the script, where the inventory check and assertion are performed. The indentation of these lines is inconsistent with the rest of the code, likely due to the use of tabs instead of spaces (or vice versa).\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent indentation throughout the script. We'll use spaces for indentation (as it's generally recommended in Python) and make sure all lines are properly aligned. Here's the corrected version of the script:\n\n```python\n# Define required resources with their respective amounts\nrequired_resources = [\n    (Resource.IronOre, 35), # slightly more than needed for safety margin\n    (Resource.Coal, 35),    # slightly more than needed for safety margin\n    (Resource.Stone, 10)    # slightly more than needed for crafting furnace\n]\n\n# Loop through each type of resource required\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in required_resources:\n    \n    # Find nearest position of the current resource type on map\n    nearest_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    print(f\"Nearest {resource_type} found at position: {nearest_position}\")\n    \n    # Move player character to location of nearest resource patch\n    move_to(nearest_position)\n    \n    print(f\"Moved to {resource_type} patch.\")\n\n    # Harvest specified quantity from located resource patch \n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(nearest_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    print(f\"Harvested {harvested_amount} units of {resource_type}.\")\n    \n    # Get updated inventory details post-harvesting operation \n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    # Log current state of player's inventory after harvesting operations are completed successfully  \n    print(f\"Current Inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n    # Ensure sufficient quantity is present in player's personal storage/inventory space as expected  \n    assert current_inventory[resource_type] >= amount_needed, \\\n        f\"Insufficient {resource_type}: Expected at least {amount_needed}, but got only {current_inventory[resource_type]}.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis corrected version maintains consistent indentation using spaces throughout the script.
