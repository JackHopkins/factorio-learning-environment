  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nCraft and place 5 inserters to automatically load or unload items.\n\nThis objective introduces the player to another crucial automation component in Factorio: inserters. It's different from the previous objectives as it focuses on crafting and using a specific item for automated item handling, rather than resource gathering, smelting, or basic transport. Inserters are essential for moving items between structures and transport belts, further advancing the player's understanding of automation in the game.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting and placing 5 inserters to automatically load or unload items in Factorio, I would recommend the following plan:\n\n1. Gather required resources:\n   - Mine iron ore\n   - Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n   - Gather wood (if playing with default settings)\n\n2. Craft intermediate components:\n   - Create iron gears (2 iron plates each)\n   - Create electronic circuits (1 iron plate, 3 copper cables)\n\n3. Craft inserters:\n   - Each inserter requires 1 electronic circuit, 1 iron gear, and 1 iron plate\n   - Craft 5 inserters using these components\n\n4. Identify suitable locations for inserter placement:\n   - Look for areas where items need to be moved between structures or transport belts\n   - Common setups include:\n     a. Moving items from an assembly machine to a transport belt\n     b. Loading items from a transport belt into a chest\n     c. Transferring items between different transport belts\n\n5. Place the inserters:\n   - Position each inserter so that its \"arm\" can reach both the source and destination of items\n   - Ensure proper orientation of the inserters (they have a distinct input and output side)\n\n6. Power the inserters:\n   - If not already available, set up a power generation system (e.g., steam engine or solar panels)\n   - Connect the inserters to the power grid using electrical poles\n\n7. Test the setup:\n   - Observe each inserter to ensure it's moving items as intended\n   - Make adjustments to positioning or orientation if necessary\n\n8. Optimize and expand:\n   - Once familiar with inserter functionality, consider setting up more complex automation systems\n   - Experiment with different inserter speeds and capacities for various tasks\n\nBy following this plan, the player will successfully craft and place 5 inserters, gaining hands-on experience with this crucial automation component in Factorio.",
