        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather initial resources, specifically coal, stone, iron ore, and copper ore.\n2. **Quantities Required**: Ensure we have at least 50 of each resource in the inventory.\n3. **Resources to Mine**:\n   - Coal for fuel\n   - Stone for crafting additional furnaces\n   - Iron Ore for smelting into iron plates\n   - Copper Ore for smelting into copper plates\n4. **Approach**:\n   - For each type of resource (coal, stone, iron ore, copper ore), find the nearest patch using `nearest(resource)`.\n   - Move to the location of each resource patch using `move_to(position)`.\n   - Harvest a bit more than needed (e.g., 55 units) to ensure we account for any inefficiencies or losses during processing.\n5. **Verification**: After harvesting each resource type, verify that at least 50 units are present in the inventory.\n\nNow let's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources required and their respective quantities to mine slightly more than needed\nresources_required = [(Resource.Coal, 55), (Resource.Stone, 55), (Resource.IronOre, 55), (Resource.CopperOre, 55)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and perform mining operations\nfor resource_type, quantity_needed in resources_required:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards the identified position of the resource patch\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting specified quantity from identified position/resource patch\n    print(f\"Harvesting {quantity_needed} units of {resource_type}\")\n    harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=quantity_needed)\n\n# Verify if we have gathered enough resources by checking our inventory after mining all resources \ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after gathering resources: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Assert checks ensuring minimum required amount is available post-harvesting operation per specified requirement \nassert current_inventory[Prototype.Coal] >= 50 , f\"Insufficient Coal! Expected at least 50 but found only {current_inventory[Prototype.Coal]}\"\nassert current_inventory[Prototype.Stone] >= 50 , f\"Insufficient Stone! Expected at least fifty but found only{current_inventory[Prototype.Stone]}\"\nassert current_inventory[Prototype.IronOre] >= fifty , f\"Inadequate Iron Ore! Anticipated minimum count being fifty however discovered merely{current_inventory[Prototype.IronOre]}\"\nassert current_inventory[Prototype.CopperOre] >= fifty ,f\"Lackluster Copper Ore collection ! Presumed baseline threshold was set around fifty yet encountered just about{current_inventory[Prototype.CopperOre]}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered initial resources with sufficient quantities!\")\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that you gather enough coal, stone, iron ore and copper ore by moving near their patches and harvesting them while checking your inventory afterwards against expected thresholds before proceeding further along script execution path .",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs on line 26 of the script, where there's an assertion check for the quantity of Iron Ore in the inventory. The error message indicates that the 'FactorioInstance' object has no attribute 'fifty'. This is because 'fifty' is being used as a variable, but it hasn't been defined anywhere in the script.\n\nThe error is likely due to a typo or inconsistency in how the minimum required quantities are being referenced. In the earlier assertions, the number 50 is used directly, but for Iron Ore and Copper Ore, 'fifty' is used instead, which Python interprets as an undefined variable.\n\nAdditionally, there's an inconsistency in how the resource types are being referenced in the inventory checks. Some use Prototype (e.g., Prototype.Coal), while others use Resource (e.g., Resource.IronOre in the harvesting loop).\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected version of the script:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources required and their respective quantities to mine slightly more than needed\nresources_required = [(Resource.Coal, 55), (Resource.Stone, 55), (Resource.IronOre, 55), (Resource.CopperOre, 55)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and perform mining operations\nfor resource_type, quantity_needed in resources_required:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move towards the identified position of the resource patch\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting specified quantity from identified position/resource patch\n    print(f\"Harvesting {quantity_needed} units of {resource_type}\")\n    harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=quantity_needed)\n\n# Verify if we have gathered enough resources by checking our inventory after mining all resources \ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after gathering resources: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Assert checks ensuring minimum required amount is available post-harvesting operation per specified requirement \nassert current_inventory[Resource.Coal] >= 50, f\"Insufficient Coal!

Presumed baseline threshold was set around 50 yet encountered just about {current_inventory[Resource.CopperOre]}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully gathered initial resources with sufficient quantities!\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n1. All references to 'fifty' have been replaced with the integer 50.\n2. The inventory checks now consistently use Resource instead of Prototype to match how the resources are defined in the resources_required list.\n3. The assertion messages have been slightly adjusted for consistency and clarity.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and ensure that the script runs as intended, gathering the required resources and performing the necessary inventory checks."
