First we need to place offshore pump on the water, then a boiler next to it with a spacing of 2 to ensure that we can connect them. Then we will fuel boiler with coal and place a steam engine next to boiler with also a spacing of 2. Finally we need to connect the offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine using pipes.",
