        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates an unexpected indent on line 25 of the script. This is a syntax error in Python, which means there's an indentation issue in the code. In Python, indentation is crucial as it defines the structure and scope of code blocks.\n\nThe error is likely caused by inconsistent use of spaces and tabs for indentation. It's a common issue when copying and pasting code or when mixing different indentation styles.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo fix this issue, we need to ensure consistent indentation throughout the code. We'll use spaces for indentation (4 spaces per indentation level is the Python standard) and make sure all lines are properly aligned. Here's the corrected version of the code:\n\n```python\n# Define required resources and their target amounts\nresources_needed = {\n    Resource.IronOre: 40,  # Slightly more than needed for safety\n    Resource.CopperOre: 20,\n    Resource.Coal: 20,\n    Resource.Stone: 10\n}\n\n# Loop through each required resource\nfor resource, target_amount in resources_needed.items():\n    # Get nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource)\n    \n    # Move towards the found position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource} location at {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvesting the required amount of current resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {target_amount} units of {resource}...\")\n    \n    # Attempt harvesting multiple times if necessary due to potential inefficiencies \n    attempts = 0\n    while inspect_inventory().get(resource, 0) < target_amount and attempts < 5:\n        harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=target_amount)\n        attempts += 1\n    \n    # Check if sufficient quantity has been gathered into inventory \n    actual_quantity = inspect_inventory().get(resource, 0)\n    assert actual_quantity >= target_amount, f\"Failed gathering enough {resource}.

Consistent indentation using 4 spaces throughout.\n2. Use of `Resource` enum instead of string keys for the resources.\n3. Removed extra indentation in the while loop.\n4. Added a final inventory print statement for verification.\n\nThis script should now run without indentation errors and properly gather the required resources."
