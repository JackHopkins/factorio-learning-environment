        "To complete this step, we need to gather the necessary resources for crafting small electric poles. The resources required are coal for fuel, copper ore to smelt into copper plates, and wood as a component in crafting. We will mine these resources from their respective locations on the map.\n\n**Planning Stage:**\n\n1. **Coal Mining:** We need at least 10 units of coal for fueling the furnace.\n2. **Copper Ore Mining:** We require at least 5 units of copper ore to smelt into copper plates.\n3. **Wood Gathering:** At least 5 units of wood are needed for crafting small electric poles.\n\nWe'll use the `nearest()` function to find the closest resource patches and then move to those positions using `move_to()`. We'll harvest each resource using `harvest_resource()` and verify that we've collected enough by inspecting our inventory with `inspect_inventory()`.\n\nLet's implement this plan:\n\n```python\n# Define the required amounts of each resource\nresources_needed = {\n    'coal': 10,\n    'copper-ore': 5,\n    'wood': 5\n}\n\n# Iterate over each type of resource needed\nfor resource_name, amount_needed in resources_needed.items():\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_name}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_name)\n    \n    # Move to the location of the resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_name} at position {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} units of {resource_name}...\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we have gathered enough resources in our inventory\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_amount_in_inventory = current_inventory.get(resource_name, 0)\n    \n    assert actual_amount_in_inventory >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_name}. Expected at least {amount_needed}, but got {actual_amount_in_inventory}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered {actual_amount_in_inventory} units of {resource_name}. Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\nfinal_inventory_check = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after gathering all resources: {final_inventory_check}\")\nassert final_inventory_check['coal'] >= 10, \"Not enough coal collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check['copper-ore'] >= 5, \"Not enough copper ore collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check['wood'] >= 5, \"Not enough wood collected.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully completed gathering all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet ensures that we have mined or gathered sufficient quantities of coal, copper ore, and wood as per our requirements before proceeding further in our script.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `nearest()` function expects a `Prototype` or `Resource` enum value, not a string. In the current implementation, we're passing string keys from the `resources_needed` dictionary directly to the `nearest()` function, which causes the AttributeError.\n\nThe error message suggests that when trying to find the nearest 'coal' (the first item in our dictionary), the function is looking for an attribute 'value' on the string 'coal', which doesn't exist.\n\nTo fix this, we need to convert our string resource names to the appropriate `Resource` enum values before passing them to the `nearest()` function.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\n# Define Resource enum if not already defined\nclass Resource(Enum):\n    Coal = 'coal'\n    CopperOre = 'copper-ore'\n    Wood = 'wood'\n\n# Define the required amounts of each resource\nresources_needed = {\n    Resource.Coal: 10,\n    Resource.CopperOre: 5,\n    Resource.Wood: 5\n}\n\n# Iterate over each type of resource needed\nfor resource, amount_needed in resources_needed.items():\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource.name}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource)\n    \n    # Move to the location of the resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource.name} at position {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} units of {resource.name}...\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we have gathered enough resources in our inventory\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_amount_in_inventory = current_inventory.get(resource.value, 0)\n    \n    assert actual_amount_in_inventory >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource.name}. Expected at least {amount_needed}, but got {actual_amount_in_inventory}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered {actual_amount_in_inventory} units of {resource.name}. Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\nfinal_inventory_check = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after gathering all resources: {final_inventory_check}\")\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.Coal.value] >= 10, \"Not enough coal collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.CopperOre.value] >= 5, \"Not enough copper ore collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.Wood.value] >= 5, \"Not enough wood collected.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully completed gathering all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis corrected version uses the `Resource` enum to properly specify the resources we're looking for. The `nearest()` function will now receive the correct enum value, and the error should be resolved. The inventory checks at the end have also been updated to use the enum values.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error message indicates that there's a TypeError when trying to use the `nearest()` function with the `Resource` enum. The error suggests that the `Resource` object is not subscriptable, which means the API might be expecting a different type of input for the `nearest()` function.\n\nThe main issues in the code are:\n\n1. The `Resource` enum is defined locally, but it should be imported from the Factorio API.\n2. The `nearest()` function might not be compatible with the custom `Resource` enum.\n3. The code assumes that the inventory keys match the enum values, which might not be the case.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to:\n\n1. Remove the local `Resource` enum definition and use the `Resource` class provided by the Factorio API.\n2. Use the correct format for resource names when calling `nearest()`.\n3. Use the correct inventory keys when checking the gathered resources.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define the required amounts of each resource\nresources_needed = {\n    Resource.Coal: 10,\n    Resource.CopperOre: 5,\n    Resource.Wood: 5\n}\n\n# Iterate over each type of resource needed\nfor resource, amount_needed in resources_needed.items():\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource}...\")\n    resource_position = nearest(resource)\n    \n    # Move to the location of the resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource} at position {resource_position}...\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} units of {resource}...\")\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we have gathered enough resources in our inventory\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_amount_in_inventory = current_inventory.get(resource.value[0], 0)\n    \n    assert actual_amount_in_inventory >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource}. Expected at least {amount_needed}, but got {actual_amount_in_inventory}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered {actual_amount_in_inventory} units of {resource}. Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\nfinal_inventory_check = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory after gathering all resources: {final_inventory_check}\")\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.Coal.value[0]] >= 10, \"Not enough coal collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.CopperOre.value[0]] >= 5, \"Not enough copper ore collected.\"\nassert final_inventory_check[Resource.Wood.value[0]] >= 5, \"Not enough wood collected.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully completed gathering all necessary resources.\")\n```\n\nThis corrected code:\n\n1. Uses the `Resource` class from the Factorio API instead of defining a custom enum.\n2. Passes the `Resource` objects directly to the `nearest()` function.\n3. Uses `resource.value[0]` to get the correct inventory key when checking gathered resources.\n\nThese changes should resolve the TypeError and allow the script to gather the required resources correctly."
