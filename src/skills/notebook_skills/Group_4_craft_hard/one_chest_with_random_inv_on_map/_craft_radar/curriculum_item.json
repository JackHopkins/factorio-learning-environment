  "full_script": "from factorio_instance import *\n\n\"\"\"\nMain Objective: We require one Radar. The final success should be checked by looking if a Radar is in inventory\n\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 1: Gather and smelt resources. We need to gather iron ore, copper ore, and stone, then smelt them into plates. Substeps include:\n- Mine iron ore, copper ore, and stone\n- Craft a stone furnace using the stone\n- Smelt iron ore and copper ore into plates using the furnace and coal from the chest on the map\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 1\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 2: Craft intermediate components. We need to craft iron gear wheels and electronic circuits. Substeps include:\n- Craft 5 iron gear wheels using 10 iron plates\n- Craft 15 copper cables using 8 copper plates\n- Craft 5 electronic circuits using 15 copper cables and 5 iron plates\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 2\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 3: Craft the Radar. Use the components to craft the Radar:\n- Combine 5 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, and 10 iron plates to craft the Radar\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 3\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 4: Verify success.
