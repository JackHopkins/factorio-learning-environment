        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs when trying to craft the burner mining drill. The error message indicates that we're missing 3 iron plates, which are required to craft the burner mining drill. This suggests that we need to smelt iron ore into iron plates before we can craft the burner mining drill.\n\nThe main issues in the current script are:\n1. We're not smelting the iron ore into iron plates before crafting.\n2. We're not crafting the intermediate items required for the burner mining drill (iron gear wheels).\n3. We're not considering the recipe requirements in the correct order.\n\nTo fix this, we need to:\n1. Craft a stone furnace first.\n2. Use the stone furnace to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n3. Craft iron gear wheels using the iron plates.\n4. Finally, craft the burner mining drill using the iron plates, iron gear wheels, and stone furnace.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Craft a stone furnace\nprint(\"Crafting stone furnace...\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\nstone_furnace_count = inspect_inventory()[Prototype.StoneFurnace]\nassert stone_furnace_count >= 1, f\"Failed to craft stone furnace.

It then crafts the necessary iron gear wheels before attempting to craft the burner mining drill. The wooden chest is crafted last. This should resolve the error and successfully craft all the required entities.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script is attempting to place a stone furnace at position (0, 0), which is too far from the player's current position (-10.5, 18.5). The game has a maximum placement distance of 10 units, and the attempted placement is about 21.27 units away.\n\nThe main issues in the script are:\n1. Attempting to place entities during the crafting step, which is not necessary and can cause errors if the player is not in the correct position.\n2. Trying to smelt iron plates, which is not required for this step and adds unnecessary complexity.\n3. Not considering the player's current position when placing entities.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to:\n1. Remove the entity placement and smelting process from this step.\n2. Focus solely on crafting the required items: stone furnace, burner mining drill, and wooden chest.\n3. Ensure we have the necessary materials for crafting without additional smelting.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Craft a stone furnace\nprint(\"Crafting stone furnace...\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\nstone_furnace_count = inspect_inventory()[Prototype.StoneFurnace]\nassert stone_furnace_count >= 1, f\"Failed to craft stone furnace.
