        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because we're trying to access the inventory using `Prototype.Wood`, which doesn't exist. In the Factorio API, resources like wood are accessed directly by their string names in the inventory, not through the Prototype enum.\n\nThe error message indicates that there's no attribute 'Wood' in the Prototype enum. This is consistent across all resource types (coal, stone, etc.) in the inventory.\n\nTo fix this, we need to use the string names of the resources directly when accessing the inventory, instead of using the Prototype enum.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Check the inventory to confirm the presence of 4 small electric poles\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Current inventory:\")\nprint(inventory)\n\n# Check if we have at least 4 small electric poles\nsmall_electric_poles_count = inventory[Prototype.SmallElectricPole]\nprint(f\"Number of small electric poles in inventory: {small_electric_poles_count}\")\n\n# Assert that we have at least 4 small electric poles\nassert small_electric_poles_count >= 4, f\"Failed to craft 4 small electric poles.
