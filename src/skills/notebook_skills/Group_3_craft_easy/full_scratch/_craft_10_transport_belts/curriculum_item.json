It's possible that the recipe in the game produces a different number of transport belts than we anticipated.\n\nTo fix this, we need to:\n1.

Resource Shortage: The script might not have enough resources to craft all 7 transport belts. Each transport belt requires 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate. We need 7 of each to craft 7 transport belts.\n\n2. Inefficient Resource Management: The script attempts to craft iron gear wheels and smelt iron plates in small batches, which might lead to inefficient use of resources.\n\n3. Incorrect Recipe Usage: The script doesn't explicitly check if it has enough resources for each craft operation, which might lead to partial crafting.\n\n4. Lack of Error Handling: The script doesn't handle cases where crafting fails due to insufficient resources, potentially leading to an infinite loop.\n\n5. Inventory Checks: The script doesn't perform thorough inventory checks before attempting to craft, which could lead to attempted crafting with insufficient resources.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nLet's correct these issues and create a more robust script:\n\n```python\n# Get the recipe for transport belts\ntransport_belt_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.TransportBelt)\nprint(f\"Recipe for Transport Belt: {transport_belt_recipe}\")\n\n# Calculate required resources\nrequired_iron_gear_wheels = 7\nrequired_iron_plates = 7\n\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Craft iron gear wheels if needed\niron_gear_wheels_to_craft = max(0, required_iron_gear_wheels - inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0))\nif iron_gear_wheels_to_craft > 0:\n    iron_plates_for_gears = iron_gear_wheels_to_craft * 2\n    if inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= iron_plates_for_gears:\n        crafted = craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, iron_gear_wheels_to_craft)\n        print(f\"Crafted {crafted} iron gear wheels\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"Not enough iron plates to craft {iron_gear_wheels_to_craft} iron gear wheels\")\n\n# Recheck inventory after crafting gear wheels\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gear wheels: {inventory}\")\n\n# Calculate remaining required resources\nremaining_iron_gear_wheels = max(0, required_iron_gear_wheels - inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0))\nremaining_iron_plates = max(0, required_iron_plates - inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0))\n\nprint(f\"Remaining required: {remaining_iron_gear_wheels} iron gear wheels, {remaining_iron_plates} iron plates\")\n\n# Check if we have enough resources to craft all 7 transport belts\nif remaining_iron_gear_wheels == 0 and remaining_iron_plates == 0:\n    # Craft transport belts\n    crafted = craft_item(Prototype.TransportBelt, 7)\n    print(f\"Crafted {crafted} transport belts\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough resources to craft all 7 transport belts\")\n    # Craft as many as possible\n    craftable = min(inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0), inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0))\n    if craftable > 0:\n        crafted = craft_item(Prototype.TransportBelt, craftable)\n        print(f\"Crafted {crafted} transport belts\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n\ntransport_belts_crafted = final_inventory.get(Prototype.TransportBelt, 0)\nassert transport_belts_crafted >= 7, f\"Failed to craft 7 transport belts.

Checking the inventory before attempting to craft.\n3. Crafting iron gear wheels first if needed.\n4. Attempting to craft all 7 transport belts if resources are sufficient, or as many as possible otherwise.\n5. Providing clear output at each step for better debugging.\n6. Using proper inventory checks and error handling.\n\nThis script should either successfully craft 7 transport belts or provide clear information about why it couldn't, allowing for easier debugging and resource management."

We need to craft transport belts. We must print the recipe for transport belts:\nTransportBelt - Crafting 2 transport belts requires 1 iron gear wheel, 1 iron plate. In total all ingredients require atleast 3 iron plates\n\nSTEP 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the following resources:\n- Iron ore (at least 12 to make 4 iron plates)\n- Coal (for fueling the stone furnace)\n- Stone (to craft a stone furnace)\n\nSTEP 3: Craft and set up smelting. We need to create a basic smelting setup:\n- Craft a stone furnace using 5 stone\n- Place the stone furnace and fuel it with coal\n- Smelt the iron ore into iron plates (we need at least 12 iron plates)\n\nSTEP 4: Craft iron gear wheels. We need to craft iron gear wheels for the transport belts:\n- Craft 4 iron gear wheels (each requires 2 iron plates, so 8 iron plates total)\n\nSTEP 5: Craft transport belts.
