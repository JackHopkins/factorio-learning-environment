        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `Resource` enum is being treated as a tuple instead of an enum. This is likely due to how the `Resource` enum is defined in the game's API. The error suggests that when we try to access `resource_type.name`, it's treating `resource_type` as a tuple, which doesn't have a `name` attribute.\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust how we're accessing the resource type. Instead of using `resource_type.name`, we should use the first element of the tuple (assuming the Resource enum is defined as a tuple of (name, type)).\n\nAdditionally, we should simplify our inventory checks by using the `Prototype` enum instead of trying to manipulate strings from the Resource enum.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define required resources\nresources_to_mine = [\n    (Prototype.CopperOre, 4),\n    (Prototype.Stone, 5)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource type we need to mine\nfor resource_prototype, amount_needed in resources_to_mine:\n    # Find nearest resource patch\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_prototype)\n    \n    # Move towards this position\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Harvest specified amount\n    harvested_amount = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if sufficient quantity was mined\n    current_inventory_count = inspect_inventory()[resource_prototype]\n    assert current_inventory_count >= amount_needed, f\"Not enough {resource_prototype.value[0]}.

Retrieve the current state of the player's inventory.\n2. Check if there are 10 copper cables in the inventory.\n3. Assert that we have exactly 10 copper cables to confirm success.\n4. Print confirmation messages for logging purposes.\n\nNow, let's implement this plan into code:\n\n```python\n# Step: Check Inventory for Copper Cables\n\n# Inspecting current inventory\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Get number of copper cables from inventory\ncopper_cable_count = current_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\nprint(f\"Copper Cables in Inventory: {copper_cable_count}\")\n\n# Assert that there are exactly 10 copper cables in the inventory\nassert copper_cable_count == 10, f\"Inventory check failed!

If everything goes as expected, we'll see a success message printed out indicating completion of this step."
