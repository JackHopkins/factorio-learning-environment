- Show AI diagnosing issues and fixing them live
- AI adds power poles, fixes belt routing, optimizes production
- Highlight: "AI can troubleshoot and fix complex engineering problems in real-time"

## **Option 4: "From Simple to Complex Automation"**
- Show AI building increasingly complex systems:
  - Basic mining → Automated smelting → Circuit production → Science pack automation
- Each step builds on the previous
- Highlight: "AI demonstrates incremental learning and system design"

## **Option 5: "AI vs Human Challenge"**
- Split screen: Human player vs AI
- Both start with same resources, race to build science packs
- Show AI's efficiency and systematic approach
- Highlight: "AI can match or exceed human performance in complex engineering tasks"

**Key talking points for any option:**
- "This is the first AI system that can play Factorio end-to-end"
- "Demonstrates real-world engineering problem-solving"
- "Shows potential for AI in manufacturing, logistics, and automation"
- "Scalable to other complex engineering domains"

Which option resonates most with your accelerator's focus (AI, automation, engineering, etc.)?

## **High-Level Approach: Building the First AI System for End-to-End Factorio**

### **Core Strategy: Multi-Modal Learning with Structured Reasoning**

**1. Foundation Layer: Environment Understanding**
- **Spatial Reasoning**: AI learns to understand 2D space, resource placement, and building constraints
- **Entity Recognition**: Distinguishes between miners, furnaces, belts, power poles, etc.
- **State Tracking**: Monitors inventory, production rates, power consumption, and system bottlenecks

**2. Planning Layer: Hierarchical Task Decomposition**
- **Goal Decomposition**: Break "build a science pack factory" into sub-tasks:
  - Mine iron ore → Smelt iron plates → Build circuits → Assemble science packs
- **Dependency Management**: Understand what needs to be built first (power before miners)
- **Resource Planning**: Calculate required materials and production chains

**3. Execution Layer: Multi-Step Reasoning**
- **Spatial Planning**: Decide where to place buildings for optimal flow
- **Connection Logic**: Understand how to link machines with belts and power
- **Problem Solving**: Diagnose and fix issues (no power, backed up belts, missing resources)

**4. Learning Approach: Hybrid Methods**
- **Imitation Learning**: Learn from human demonstrations of common patterns
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Optimize for efficiency, throughput, and resource usage
- **Large Language Models**: Use reasoning capabilities for complex planning and problem-solving

### **Key Innovations:**

**1. Structured Observation Space**
- Convert Factorio's complex state into structured data (entities, inventories, production flows)
- Enable AI to "see" the game state in a way that supports reasoning

**2. Multi-Agent Coordination**
- Multiple AI agents working together (miner, smelter, builder)
- Agents communicate and coordinate to achieve complex goals

**3. Real-Time Adaptation**
- AI can respond to changing conditions and fix problems as they arise
- Continuous optimization based on performance feedback

### **Technical Stack:**
- **Environment**: Custom Factorio mod with API for AI interaction
- **AI Models**: LLMs for planning + specialized models for spatial reasoning
- **Training**: Combination of supervised learning from demonstrations + RL for optimization

### **Success Metrics:**
- Complete science pack production chains
- Efficient resource utilization
- Problem diagnosis and resolution
- Scalable to more complex factory designs

**The breakthrough is combining spatial reasoning, hierarchical planning, and real-time problem-solving into a single AI system that can handle the complexity of Factorio's engineering challenges.**
