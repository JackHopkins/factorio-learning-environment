Main Objective: We need to set up copper ore transport from a a drill to a furnace. You need to send the correct ore to the furnace smelting that ore. To see which ore a drill is mining, find the resource patch it's closest to.  The final setup should be checked by looking if the furnace where we sent copper to has more copper ore than starting
"""



"""
Step 1: Identify the copper ore drill and furnace. We need to:
- Determine which of the two drills is closest to the copper ore patch
- Confirm that the furnace at (0.0, -5.0) is the one processing copper ore

"""
Step 2: Set up the transport system. We need to:
- Place transport belts from the copper ore drill's drop position towards the copper furnace
- Place a burner inserter next to the furnace, rotated to insert items into it
- Connect the transport belts to the burner inserter's pickup position

"""
Step 3: Fuel the burner inserter. We need to:
- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5) which contains coal
- Take some coal from this chest
- Move to the burner inserter and add fuel to it
"""

"""
Step 4: Start the system and verify. We need to:
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow the system to operate
- Check the copper ore count in the furnace to ensure it has increased from the starting amount of 49
