1. **Multiple Entity Placement**
Example: Create a copper plate mining line with 3 drills with inserters for future integration
```python
# log your general idea what you will do next
print(f"I will create a single line of 3 drills to mine copper ore")
# Find space for a line of 3 miners
move_to(source_position)
# define the BuildingBox for the drill. 
# We need 3 drills so width is 3*drill.WIDTH, height is drill.HEIGHT + furnace.HEIGHT, 3 for drill, one for furnace
building_box = BuildingBox(width = 3 * Prototype.ElectricMiningDrill.WIDTH, height = Prototype.ElectricMiningDrill.HEIGHT + Prototype.StoneFurnace.HEIGHT)
# get the nearest buildable area around the source_position
buildable_coordinates = nearest_buildable(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, building_box, source_position)

# Place miners in a line
# we first get the leftmost coordinate of the buildingbox to start building from
left_top = buildable_coordinates.left_top
# first lets move to the left_top to ensure building
move_to(left_top)
for i in range(3):
    # we now iterate from the leftmost point towards the right
    # take steps of drill.WIDTH
    drill_pos = Position(x=left_top.x + Prototype.ElectricMiningDrill.WIDTH*i, y=left_top.y)
    # Place the drill facing down as we start from top coordinate
    # The drop position will be below the drill as the direction is DOWN
    drill = place_entity(Prototype.ElectricMiningDrill, position=drill_pos, direction = Direction.DOWN)
    print(f"Placed ElectricMiningDrill {i} at {drill.position} to mine copper ore")
    # place a furnace to catch the ore
    # We use the Direction.DOWN as the direction, as the drill direction is DOWN which means the drop position is below the drill
    furnace = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.StoneFurnace, reference_position=drill.position, direction = Direction.DOWN)
    print(f"Placed furnace at {furnace.position} to smelt the copper ore for drill {i} at {drill.position}")
    # add inserters for future potential integartion
    # put them below the furnace as the furnace is below the drill
    inserter = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.Inserter, reference_position=furnace.position, direction = Direction.DOWN)
    print(f"Placed inserter at {inserter.position} to get the plates from furnace {i} at {furnace.position}")
