"""
Main Objective: We require one Lab. The final success should be checked by looking if a Lab is in inventory
"""



"""
Step 1: Print recipes and gather resources. We need to print the recipes for Lab, Electronic Circuit, Iron Gear Wheel, and Transport Belt. Then, we need to gather the following resources:
- Mine iron ore and copper ore from the chest on the map
- Mine additional iron ore, copper ore, coal, and stone from the environment
- Craft stone furnaces for smelting
"""
# Placeholder 1

"""
Step 2: Smelt plates. We need to smelt the gathered ore into plates:
- Craft and place stone furnaces
- Fuel the furnaces with coal
- Smelt iron ore into iron plates
- Smelt copper ore into copper plates
"""
# Placeholder 2

"""
Step 3: Craft intermediate components. We need to craft the following:
- Craft copper cables from copper plates
- Craft iron gear wheels from iron plates
- Craft electronic circuits from copper cables and iron plates
- Craft transport belts from iron gear wheels and iron plates
"""
# Placeholder 3

"""
Step 4: Craft the Lab. Using the crafted components, we will now craft the Lab:
- Craft 1 Lab using 10 electronic circuits, 10 iron gear wheels, and 4 transport belts
"""
# Placeholder 4

"""
Step 5: Verify success. Check the inventory to confirm that a Lab has been crafted and is present.
