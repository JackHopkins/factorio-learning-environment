"""
Main Objective: We require one AssemblingMachine. The final success should be checked by looking if a AssemblingMachine is in inventory
"""



"""
Step 1: Gather resources and craft furnaces. We need to:
- Mine stone to craft 2 stone furnaces (10 stone)
- Mine iron ore (at least 22)
- Mine copper ore (at least 5)
- Mine coal for fuel (at least 20)
- Craft 2 stone furnaces
"""
# Placeholder 1

"""
Step 2: Set up smelting operations. We need to:
- Place down the two stone furnaces
- Fuel the furnaces with coal
- Smelt iron ore into iron plates (22 needed)
- Smelt copper ore into copper plates (5 needed)
"""
# Placeholder 2

"""
Step 3: Craft intermediate components. We need to craft:
- 15 copper cables (from 5 copper plates)
- 5 iron gear wheels (from 10 iron plates)
- 3 electronic circuits (from 3 iron plates and 9 copper cables)
"""

"""
Step 4: Craft the AssemblingMachine. We need to:
- Use 3 electronic circuits, 5 iron gear wheels, and 9 iron plates to craft 1 AssemblingMachine
"""
# Placeholder 4

"""
Step 5: Verify success. We need to:
- Check the inventory to confirm that 1 AssemblingMachine is present
