Since our inventory is empty, we need to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and then craft the BurnerInserter.\n\nWe have a stone furnace on the map, but it's out of fuel and has no ingredients. We'll need to mine coal for fuel and iron ore for smelting. After smelting the iron plates, we can craft the iron gear wheel and then the BurnerInserter.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Mine resources\n- Move to the nearest coal patch and mine at least 5 coal\n- Move to the nearest iron ore patch and mine at least 3 iron ore\nOUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have at least 5 coal and 3 iron ore in the inventory\n\nSTEP 2: Prepare the furnace\n- Move to the existing stone furnace at position (-12.0, -12.0)\n- Add coal to the furnace as fuel\nOUTPUT CHECK: Check if the furnace status changes from NO_FUEL to IDLE\n\nSTEP 3: Smelt iron plates\n- Add iron ore to the furnace\n- Wait for the smelting process to complete (3 seconds for 3 iron ore)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have at least 3 iron plates in the inventory\n\nSTEP 4: Craft iron gear wheel\n- Craft 1 iron gear wheel using 2 iron plates\nOUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have 1 iron gear wheel in the inventory\n\nSTEP 5: Craft BurnerInserter\n- Craft 1 BurnerInserter using 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate\nOUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have 1 BurnerInserter in the inventory\n\n###END OF PLAN",
