  "objective": "Create a small electric network by connecting 3 steam engines to 2 electric mining drills",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of creating a small electric network by connecting 3 steam engines to 2 electric mining drills in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine iron ore and coal\n   - Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n   - Craft necessary components (gears, pipes, etc.)\n\n2. Create a water source:\n   - Place an offshore pump near a body of water\n\n3. Set up the steam engines:\n   - Place 3 steam engines in a row\n   - Connect the offshore pump to the first steam engine using pipes\n   - Connect the steam engines to each other with pipes\n\n4. Build boilers:\n   - Place 1-2 boilers between the offshore pump and the first steam engine\n   - Connect the boilers to the water supply and steam engines using pipes\n\n5. Fuel the boilers:\n   - Set up a coal mining operation or manually insert coal into the boilers\n\n6. Set up the electric network:\n   - Craft and place wooden poles or small electric poles to connect the steam engines\n\n7. Place the electric mining drills:\n   - Position 2 electric mining drills over resource patches (e.g., coal or iron ore)\n   - Ensure the drills are within range of the electric network\n\n8. Connect everything:\n   - Use additional electric poles if necessary to connect the mining drills to the steam engine network\n\n9. Start the system:\n   - Ensure boilers have fuel\n   - Verify that steam is being produced and the engines are generating electricity\n   - Confirm that the mining drills are receiving power and operating\n\nThis setup will create a small, functional electric network powered by 3 steam engines and operating 2 electric mining drills.",
