        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs when trying to inspect the inventory of the chest using `inspect_inventory(chest)`. The error message suggests that the function is attempting to inspect a transport belt instead of the wooden chest. This indicates that the `chest` variable is not correctly referencing the wooden chest entity.\n\nThe issue likely stems from how we're retrieving the chest entity. The `get_entities()` function might be returning a list of all entities, including transport belts, instead of just the wooden chest. We need to ensure we're correctly filtering for and selecting the wooden chest.\n\nAdditionally, the `inspect_inventory()` function seems to expect an entity as an argument, not the entity object itself.

We have all the necessary components in our inventory, so we don't need to craft anything. The plan will involve placing the drill on a copper patch, placing the chest at a distance, setting up the inserter, and connecting everything with transport belts. Finally, we'll need to fuel the drill and inserter and check if the setup is working correctly.\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Place the burner mining drill. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Move to a copper ore patch\n- Place the burner mining drill on the copper ore patch\n- Add coal to fuel the burner mining drill\n\nSTEP 2: Place the wooden chest. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Move to a position further away from the drill (at least 5 tiles away)\n- Place the wooden chest at this position\n\nSTEP 3: Set up the burner inserter. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Move next to the wooden chest\n- Place the burner inserter adjacent to the chest\n- Rotate the inserter so it will insert items into the chest\n- Add coal to fuel the burner inserter\n\nSTEP 4: Connect the drill to the inserter. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Use transport belts to connect the drop position of the burner mining drill to the pickup position of the burner inserter\n- Ensure the belt is properly aligned and connected\n\nSTEP 5: Verify the setup. We need to carry out the following substeps:\n- Wait for 30 seconds to allow the system to operate\n- Check the contents of the wooden chest for copper ore\n- If copper ore is present, the setup is working correctly\n###END OF PLAN",
