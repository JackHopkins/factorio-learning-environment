Plan Analysis:
To solve this objective, we need a burner mining drill, a burner inserter, a wooden chest and transport belts (atleast 10).
Firstly we must craft the entities as there are no resources or entities in our inventory. For that we must first print out recipes, gather resources and craft all the required entities.
After that we must place the burner minng drill onto a copper patch, place a chest further away, place an inserter next to the chest and connect the drill with the inserter. We can check the final mine by looking if the chest has any copper ore in it

###START OF PLAN
STEP 1: Print recipes. We need to craft a burner mining drill, a burner inserter, a wooden chest and some transport belts (atleast 10). We must print the recipes of all the items we need to craft
STEP 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the resources needed to craft the items required. As the recipes involve smelting ore into plates, we also need to gather coal and stone to craft a furnace. We also need to gather coal to fuel the burner drill on the copper ore and the chest inserter. Therefore we need to gather:
- Enough coal to fuel the inserter and furnace
- Enough copper and iron for crafting the required entities
- Enough stone for 2 stone furnaces, one for crafting the drill and one for smelting the plates
OUTPUT CHECK: We need to check if after this step we have all the specified resources in our inventory
STEP 3: Smelt plates. We need to smelt the plates using a stone furnace. We also need the craft the stone furnace. The substeps are then
- Craft a stone furnace for smelting, place it down and fuel it
- Smelt the plates using the stone furnace
OUTPUT CHECK: We need to check if after this step we have the required plates in our inventory
STEP 4: Craft the entities. We need to craft the following entities
- Burner mining drill
- Burner inserter
- Wooden chest
- Transport belts (atleast 10)
OUTPUT CHECK: We need to check if after this step we have the all of the above in our inventory
STEP 6: Place the drill and the chest. We need to place the drill on the copper and a chest further away from it. OUTPUT CHECK: We need to check if after this step we the entities were placed successfully
STEP 7: Connect drill to chest. To connect the drill we need to achieve the following substeps
- First put a inserter next to the chest and rotate the inserter to put items into the chest
- Connect the drills drop position with the inserter pickup position with transport belts
OUTPUT CHECK: We need to wait a bit and then see if the chest has any copper ore in it. That will show us if the mine works
