This suggests that there were already burner inserters on the map before our script ran, which we didn't account for. We need to modify our approach to handle this situation.\n\nThe main issues are:\n1. We're not considering existing entities on the map.\n2. We're using a global check for the number of inserters, which is not reliable if there are pre-existing inserters.\n3. We're not specifically checking for the inserters we just placed.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo fix these issues, we'll make the following changes:\n1. We'll use the `get_entities()` function to check for existing inserters near our target positions.\n2. Instead of checking the total number of inserters, we'll verify the presence of our newly placed inserters at the specific locations.\n3.
