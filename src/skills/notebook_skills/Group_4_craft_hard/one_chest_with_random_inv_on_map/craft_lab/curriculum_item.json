This is likely due to the assertion statement at the end of the script being incomplete. The last line of the script is cut off, which suggests that the closing parenthesis for the `assert` statement is missing.\n\nAdditionally, while not directly related to the syntax error, there are a few improvements we can make to the script:\n\n1. We should use `get_prototype_recipe()` instead of `get_recipe()` as per the provided API.\n2.

The `harvest_resource` function might have failed to mine the stone.\n3. There might not be enough stone in the game world to meet our requirements.\n\nTo address this, we need to modify our resource gathering approach:\n1.

We need to smelt the gathered ore into plates:\n- Craft and place stone furnaces\n- Fuel the furnaces with coal\n- Smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Smelt copper ore into copper plates\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 2\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 3: Craft intermediate components. We need to craft the following:\n- Craft copper cables from copper plates\n- Craft iron gear wheels from iron plates\n- Craft electronic circuits from copper cables and iron plates\n- Craft transport belts from iron gear wheels and iron plates\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 3\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 4: Craft the Lab. Using the crafted components, we will now craft the Lab:\n- Craft 1 Lab using 10 electronic circuits, 10 iron gear wheels, and 4 transport belts\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 4\n\n\"\"\"\nStep 5: Verify success. Check the inventory to confirm that a Lab has been crafted and is present.\n##\n\"\"\"\n# Placeholder 5",
