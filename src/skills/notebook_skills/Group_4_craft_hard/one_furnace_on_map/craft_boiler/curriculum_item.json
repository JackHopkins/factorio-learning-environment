        "To achieve the current step, we need to gather resources necessary for crafting pipes and fueling the furnace. Specifically, we need at least 4 iron ore to smelt into iron plates for crafting pipes, and some coal to fuel the furnace during the smelting process. The plan is to locate nearby resource patches of iron ore and coal, move towards them, harvest a sufficient amount of each resource, and then verify that they are present in our inventory.\n\nPLANNING STAGE:\n1. Identify the nearest positions of iron ore and coal using `nearest(Resource.IronOre)` and `nearest(Resource.Coal)`.\n2. Move to these positions one by one.\n3. Harvest at least 4 units of iron ore.\n4. Harvest a reasonable quantity of coal (let's say at least 5 units).\n5. After harvesting each type of resource, check if they have been added correctly to our inventory.\n6.
