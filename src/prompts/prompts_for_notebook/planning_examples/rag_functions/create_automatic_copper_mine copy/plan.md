Plan Analysis:
To solve this objective, we need a burner mining drill, a burner inserter, a wooden chest and transport belts (atleast 10). We have all the required entities in our inventory so we don't need to craft anything.

We must place the burner minng drill onto a copper patch, place a chest further away, place an inserter next to the chest and connect the drill with the inserter. We can check the final mine by looking if the chest has any copper ore in it

###START OF PLAN
STEP 1: Place the drill and the chest. We need to place the drill on the copper and a chest further away from it.
STEP 2: Connect drill to chest. To connect the drill we need to achieve the following substeps
- First put a inserter next to the chest and rotate the inserter to put items into the chest
- Connect the drills drop position with the inserter pickup position with transport belts
