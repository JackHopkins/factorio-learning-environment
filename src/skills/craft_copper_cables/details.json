Locate copper ore:\n   - Explore the map to find copper ore deposits, which appear as orange patches on the ground.\n\n2. Mine copper ore:\n   - Use your pickaxe to manually mine copper ore until you have collected at least 10 pieces.\n\n3. Smelt copper ore into copper plates:\n   - Place a stone furnace on the ground.\n   - Add coal or wood to the furnace as fuel.\n   - Insert the copper ore into the furnace.\n   - Wait for the copper ore to smelt into copper plates.\n   - Collect at least 10 copper plates from the furnace output.\n\n4. Access the crafting menu:\n   - Open your inventory by pressing 'E'.\n   - Navigate to the crafting section of the inventory screen.\n\n5. Locate the copper cable recipe:\n   - Find the copper cable recipe in the crafting menu.\n   - Note that each copper plate produces 2 copper cables.\n\n6. Craft copper cables:\n   - Select the copper cable recipe.\n   - Click the craft button or press the appropriate key to craft copper cables.\n   - Repeat the crafting process until you have produced 20 copper cables.\n\n7. Verify completion:\n   - Check your inventory to confirm that you have successfully crafted 20 copper cables.\n\nThis plan introduces the player to basic resource gathering, smelting, and crafting mechanics while focusing on a single, specific task using copper as a new resource.",
