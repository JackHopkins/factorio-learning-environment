        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs when trying to verify if the furnace has been refueled. The line `furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace.position)` is causing the issue. This suggests that the furnace entity is not being found at the expected position.\n\nThere are a few potential reasons for this:\n\n1. The furnace position might have changed after inserting coal.\n2. The `get_entity` function might not be working as expected.\n3. The furnace entity might have been modified or removed during the refueling process.\n\nTo address this, we can make the following changes:\n\n1. Remove the verification step using `get_entity` as it's causing issues and is not necessary.\n2. Use `inspect_entities` to get the updated state of entities after refueling.\n3. Add more robust error handling and logging.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for refueling the stone furnaces:\n\n```python\n# Get all stone furnaces on the map\nstone_furnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"Found {len(stone_furnaces)} stone furnaces\")\n\n# Identify the coal chest\ncoal_chest_position = Position(x=5.5, y=-4.5)\ncoal_chest = get_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, coal_chest_position)\nprint(f\"Coal chest found at {coal_chest_position}\")\n\n# Amount of coal to insert into each furnace\ncoal_amount = 5\n\n# Refuel each stone furnace\nfor furnace in stone_furnaces:\n    print(f\"Refueling furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to the furnace\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    print(f\"Moved to furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to the coal chest\n    move_to(coal_chest_position)\n    print(f\"Moved to coal chest at {coal_chest_position}\")\n    \n    # Extract coal from the chest\n    extracted_coal = extract_item(Prototype.Coal, coal_chest_position, coal_amount)\n    print(f\"Extracted {extracted_coal} coal from the chest\")\n    \n    # Move back to the furnace\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    print(f\"Moved back to furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Insert coal into the furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, coal_amount)\n    print(f\"Inserted {coal_amount} coal into the furnace\")\n\n# Verify refueling using inspect_entities\nrefueled_furnaces = inspect_entities(radius=30).get_entities(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nfor furnace in refueled_furnaces:\n    if furnace.fuel:\n        print(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position} has been successfully refueled\")\n    else:\n        print(f\"WARNING: Furnace at {furnace.position} could not be refueled\")\n\nprint(\"All stone furnaces have been refueled\")\n```\n\nThis corrected version removes the problematic `get_entity` call and instead uses `inspect_entities` to verify the refueling process.

From the mining setup, we can see that there are three stone furnaces and two burner mining drills that need fuel. We have a chest on the map that contains 100 coal, which we can use for refueling. We don't need to craft anything as we have all the necessary items.\n\nThe plan will involve moving to each entity that needs fuel, taking coal from the chest, and adding it to the entity. After refueling all entities, we'll check if they all have fuel to ensure the setup is correct.\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Refuel stone furnaces. We need to refuel three stone furnaces. For each furnace, we will:\n- Move to the furnace\n- Take coal from the chest at (5.5, -4.5)\n- Add coal to the furnace\n\nSTEP 2: Refuel burner mining drills. We need to refuel two burner mining drills. For each drill, we will:\n- Move to the drill\n- Take coal from the chest at (5.5, -4.5)\n- Add coal to the drill\n\nSTEP 3: Verify refueling. We need to check if all entities have been successfully refueled:\n- Move to each refueled entity (3 furnaces and 2 drills)\n- Check if each entity has fuel\n###END OF PLAN",
