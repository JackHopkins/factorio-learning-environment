"""
Main Objective: We require one BurnerMiningDrill. The final success should be checked by looking if a BurnerMiningDrill is in inventory
"""



"""
Step 1: Gather resources
- Move to and mine iron ore (at least 18 iron ore for 9 iron plates)
- Move to and mine coal (at least 10 for fueling the furnace)
OUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have at least 18 iron ore and 10 coal in the inventory
"""
# Placeholder 1

"""
Step 2: Prepare the furnace for smelting
- Move to the existing stone furnace at position (-12.0, -12.0)
- Add coal to the furnace as fuel
OUTPUT CHECK: Check if the furnace status changes from NO_FUEL to IDLE
"""
# Placeholder 2

"""
Step 3: Smelt iron plates
- Add iron ore to the furnace
- Wait for the smelting process to complete (9 iron plates)
OUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have at least 9 iron plates in the inventory
"""
# Placeholder 3

"""
Step 4: Craft iron gear wheels
- Craft 3 iron gear wheels (each requires 2 iron plates)
OUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have 3 iron gear wheels in the inventory
"""
# Placeholder 4

"""
Step 5: Craft BurnerMiningDrill
- Craft 1 BurnerMiningDrill using 3 iron gear wheels, 3 iron plates, and the existing stone furnace
OUTPUT CHECK: Check if we have 1 BurnerMiningDrill in the inventory
