We have a stone furnace on the map, but it's out of fuel, so we'll need to gather coal as well.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps we need to take:\n1. Gather resources (iron ore, copper ore, coal, stone)\n2. Smelt iron and copper plates\n3. Craft intermediate components (iron gear wheels, electronic circuits)\n4. Craft the Radar\n\nLet's create a detailed plan to achieve this objective.\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Print recipes. We need to craft a Radar, which requires intermediate components.

We need to:\n- Move to the existing stone furnace at position (-12.0, -12.0)\n- Add coal to the furnace as fuel\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that the furnace status changes from NO_FUEL to IDLE.\n\nSTEP 4: Smelt iron plates. We need to:\n- Add iron ore to the furnace\n- Wait for the smelting process to complete\n- Collect the iron plates\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 30 iron plates in our inventory.\n\nSTEP 5: Smelt copper plates. We need to:\n- Add copper ore to the furnace\n- Wait for the smelting process to complete\n- Collect the copper plates\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 10 copper plates in our inventory.\n\nSTEP 6: Craft iron gear wheels.
