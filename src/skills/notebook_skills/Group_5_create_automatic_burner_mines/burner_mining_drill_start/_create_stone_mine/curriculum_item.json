Finds the nearest stone patch.\n2. Moves to that stone patch.\n3. Places a burner mining drill on the stone patch.\n4. Verifies that the drill was placed successfully.\n5. Inserts coal into the drill to fuel it.\n6.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script is attempting to verify the presence of coal in the burner mining drill's inventory, but it's failing to do so. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The `inspect_inventory(drill)` function might not be correctly accessing the fuel inventory of the burner mining drill. It's possible that the fuel inventory is separate from the main inventory.\n\n2. The `insert_item()` function might not be correctly inserting the coal into the drill's fuel inventory.\n\n3. There might be a delay between inserting the coal and it appearing in the inventory, causing the immediate check to fail.\n\n4. The API for checking the fuel inventory of a burner entity might be different from what we're using.\n\nGiven the information that getting the fuel_inventory has a bug and will be fixed soon, we should avoid checking the fuel inventory directly. Instead, we can assume that the fueling step was done correctly if no error was raised during the `insert_item()` call.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for Placeholder 1:\n\n```python\n# Find the nearest stone patch\nstone_patch_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Nearest stone patch found at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Move to the stone patch\nmove_to(stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to stone patch at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Place the burner mining drill on the stone patch\ndrill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Direction.UP, stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Placed burner mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Verify that the drill was placed\nnearby_entities = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill}, stone_patch_position, radius=1)\nassert len(nearby_entities) > 0, \"Failed to place burner mining drill\"\nprint(\"Successfully placed burner mining drill\")\n\n# Fuel the burner mining drill with coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Inserted coal into burner mining drill\")\n\n# We'll assume the fueling was successful if no error was raised\nprint(\"Completed setting up burner mining drill on stone patch\")\n\n# Wait a short time to allow the drill to start working\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check if the drill is working by inspecting its status\ndrill_info = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, drill.position)\nassert drill_info.status == EntityStatus.WORKING, f\"Drill is not working. Current status: {drill_info.status}\"\nprint(\"Burner mining drill is operational\")\n```\n\nIn this corrected version:\n\n1. We've removed the direct check of the fuel inventory.\n2. We've added a short sleep to allow the drill to start working.\n3. We've added a check of the drill's status to ensure it's operational.\n\nThis approach avoids the problematic fuel inventory check while still verifying that the drill is functional after being placed and fueled.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the burner mining drill is not in the \"WORKING\" state as expected. Instead, it's in the \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" state. This suggests that the drill has nowhere to output the mined stone.\n\nThe main issues in the current script are:\n\n1. The script doesn't account for the fact that the burner mining drill needs a place to output its products.\n2. The assertion check for the drill's status is too strict and doesn't allow for other valid states.\n3. The wait time of 5 seconds might not be enough for the drill to start working.\n\nTo fix these issues, we need to:\n\n1. Place a chest next to the drill to collect the mined stone.\n2. Adjust the assertion to check for valid working states, including \"WORKING\" and \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\".\n3.

It also includes more detailed logging and assertions to help diagnose any potential issues.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script is expecting to find stone in the wooden chest immediately after setting up the mining operation. However, mining and transporting resources takes time, and the current setup doesn't account for this delay properly. Additionally, the current setup places the wooden chest directly next to the drill, which isn't part of the main objective. The main objective states that we need to place the chest \"further away\" from the drill and use an inserter and transport belts to move the stone.\n\nHere are the main issues:\n1. The chest is placed directly next to the drill, which doesn't match the objective.\n2. There's no inserter or transport belt set up to move stone from the drill to the chest.\n3. The wait time (10 seconds) might not be long enough for the mining and transportation process to complete.\n4. The script is trying to verify the entire setup in this step, while the objective breaks this into multiple steps.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nLet's correct the script to focus only on placing and fueling the burner mining drill, as per the step description:\n\n```python\n# Find the nearest stone patch\nstone_patch_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Nearest stone patch found at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Move to the stone patch\nmove_to(stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Moved to stone patch at: {stone_patch_position}\")\n\n# Place the burner mining drill on the stone patch\ndrill = place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Direction.UP, stone_patch_position)\nprint(f\"Placed burner mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Verify that the drill was placed\nnearby_entities = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill}, stone_patch_position, radius=1)\nassert len(nearby_entities) > 0, \"Failed to place burner mining drill\"\nprint(\"Successfully placed burner mining drill\")\n\n# Fuel the burner mining drill with coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Inserted coal into burner mining drill\")\n\n# Check if the drill is in a valid working state\ndrill_info = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, drill.position)\nvalid_states = [EntityStatus.WORKING, EntityStatus.NORMAL]\nassert drill_info.status in valid_states, f\"Drill is not in a valid working state.
