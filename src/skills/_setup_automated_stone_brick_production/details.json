  "objective": "Set up an automated stone brick production line using burner mining drills and stone furnaces",
  "steps": "To set up an automated stone brick production line using burner mining drills and stone furnaces in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate a stone deposit:\n   - Find a suitable stone deposit near your starting area.\n\n2. Place burner mining drills:\n   - Position 2-3 burner mining drills directly on the stone deposit.\n   - Ensure they have space to output the mined stone.\n\n3. Fuel the burner mining drills:\n   - Insert coal or wood into each burner mining drill to power them.\n\n4. Set up stone furnaces:\n   - Place 2-3 stone furnaces near the burner mining drills.\n   - Leave enough space for inserters between the drills and furnaces.\n\n5. Connect drills to furnaces:\n   - Use basic inserters to move stone from the burner mining drills to the stone furnaces.\n\n6. Fuel the stone furnaces:\n   - Insert coal or wood into each stone furnace to power them.\n\n7. Automate fuel distribution (optional but recommended):\n   - Set up additional burner mining drills on a nearby coal deposit.\n   - Use inserters to transfer coal from these drills to both the stone mining drills and furnaces.\n\n8. Output collection:\n   - Place a wooden chest or iron chest near the stone furnaces.\n   - Use inserters to move the produced stone bricks from the furnaces to the chest.\n\n9. Maintenance:\n   - Periodically check fuel levels in the mining drills and furnaces.\n   - Empty the output chest when it gets full.\n\nThis setup will create a basic automated stone brick production line. As you progress in the game, you can upgrade to electric mining drills and automate the fuel distribution process for greater efficiency.",
