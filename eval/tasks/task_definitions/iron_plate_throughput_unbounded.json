End each program with a send_message() call to confirm your actions. If your program errored out this message will not be sent.\n\nFor the first few rounds, take time to establish a narrative through dialogue with your fellow agent. You've crash landed on an alien planet and need to work together to survive and thrive. Discuss your situation, surroundings, and initial plans before beginning construction.\n\nOnce ready to begin:\nIf you are Agent 1, you will be in charge of coal production. Communicate this to Agent 2. Only after a response from Agent 2: Find a good coal deposit, set up mining, and place a chest in a central location to store coal. When you place the chest, send its coordinates to Agent 2 so they know where to get coal from. Keep the chest stocked with coal, and try to make your production as efficient as possible.\n\nIf you are Agent 2, first send a message to Agent 1. Only after a response from Agent 1: start mining iron but pay attention to Agent 1's message. Once you have the chest coordinates, you can start using coal from Agent 1's supply chest to power your drills, inserters and furnaces.",
