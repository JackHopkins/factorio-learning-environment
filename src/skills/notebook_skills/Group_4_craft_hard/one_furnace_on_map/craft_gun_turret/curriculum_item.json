This suggests that the Resource enum is structured differently than expected. The error is in the inventory checking part of the code, specifically when trying to get the count of resources from the inventory.\n\nThe main issues are:\n1. Incorrect access of Resource enum values\n2. Potentially incorrect use of the inspect_inventory() function\n3. The inventory might be storing resources differently than expected\n\nTo fix this, we need to:\n1. Correctly access the Resource enum values\n2. Use the correct method to check the inventory\n3.
