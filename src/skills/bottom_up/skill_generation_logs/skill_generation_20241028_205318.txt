[2024-10-28 20:53:18] Base skills selected:
[2024-10-28 20:53:18]   - test_collect_iron_ore: Tests if a player can successfully harvest 10 iron ore by finding the nearest iron ore resource, moving to it, and collecting it. Verifies the correct quantity is added to inventory.
[2024-10-28 20:53:18]   - test_another_self_fueling_coal_belt: Tests the automated construction of a self-sustaining coal mining system by verifying: 1) location and size of a suitable coal patch, 2) placement of 5 burner mining drills with inserters in a line, 3) creation of a closed transport belt loop connecting all components, and 4) initialization of the system with coal. Ensures all components are correctly placed and connected to form a working automated coal extraction setup.
[2024-10-28 20:53:18]   - test_simple_automated_drill: Tests automated placement and configuration of a basic coal mining setup in a factory automation system. Verifies correct positioning and connection of a burner mining drill, inserter, and transport belts to create a functional coal extraction loop. Checks that components are properly oriented and connected to enable automated coal mining and transport.
[2024-10-28 20:53:18] Combined inventory requirements: {'stone-furnace': 2, 'iron-chest': 6, 'burner-inserter': 12, 'coal': 100, 'transport-belt': 100, 'burner-mining-drill': 10}
[2024-10-28 20:53:21] Generated objective: Implement a snippet that creates an automated iron ore processing line by: 1) locating an iron ore patch, 2) setting up 3 electric mining drills powered by a small coal-fired steam engine, 3) connecting the drills via transport belts to a line of 2 stone furnaces, and 4) using inserters to feed coal to the furnaces and collect the resulting iron plates. Verify the system maintains continuous iron plate production for at least 2 minutes.
