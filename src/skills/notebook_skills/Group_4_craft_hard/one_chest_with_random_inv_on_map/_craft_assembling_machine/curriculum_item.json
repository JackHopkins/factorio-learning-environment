The assertion at the end of the script is failing because it expects at least 10 stone in the inventory, but only 5 are present. This could be due to several reasons:\n\n1. The harvest_resource function might not be harvesting the full requested amount.\n2. There might not be enough stone resources in the vicinity.\n3. The player's inventory might have a capacity limit that we're not accounting for.\n\nTo address this, we need to modify our resource gathering approach:\n\n1. We should implement a loop that continues harvesting until we have the required amount or we've made several attempts.\n2. We should check the inventory after each harvest to see how much we've actually gathered.\n3.

It also checks the inventory after each harvest to accurately track how much we've gathered. If a resource patch is depleted, it will automatically move to the next nearest patch in the next iteration. This should ensure we gather enough of each resource, including stone, to meet our requirements.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the script fails to gather enough stone. The assertion at line 48 checks if we have at least 10 stone, but we only have 5. This indicates that the resource gathering process for stone was not successful.\n\nThe issue likely stems from the resource gathering loop. It's possible that the `harvest_resource` function is not returning the expected amount of resources, or that the resource patches are depleted before we can gather the required amount.\n\nAdditionally, the script doesn't account for the possibility that resources might be scattered across multiple patches. If a single patch is depleted, the current implementation won't move to the next nearest patch.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nTo address these issues, we'll make the following changes:\n1. Increase the maximum number of attempts for resource gathering.\n2. Add a check to move to a new resource patch if the current one is depleted.\n3. Implement a more robust gathering loop that continues until we have the required resources or have exhausted all attempts.\n\nHere's the corrected code for Placeholder 1:\n\n```python\nfrom factorio_instance import *\n\n# Define the resources we need to gather\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.Stone, 15),  # Extra 5 for safety\n    (Resource.IronOre, 30),  # Extra 8 for safety\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 10),  # Extra 5 for safety\n    (Resource.Coal, 25)  # Extra 5 for safety\n]\n\n# Gather resources\nfor resource, amount_needed in resources_needed:\n    amount_gathered = 0\n    attempts = 0\n    max_attempts = 10  # Increased from 5 to 10\n\n    while amount_gathered < amount_needed and attempts < max_attempts:\n        resource_position = nearest(resource)\n        print(f\"Moving to {resource} at position {resource_position}\")\n        move_to(resource_position)\n        \n        amount_to_harvest = min(amount_needed - amount_gathered, 10)  # Harvest in smaller batches\n        print(f\"Attempting to harvest {amount_to_harvest} {resource}\")\n        harvested = harvest_resource(resource_position, amount_to_harvest)\n        print(f\"Harvested {harvested} {resource}\")\n        \n        inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        amount_gathered = inventory[resource]\n        print(f\"Total {resource} gathered: {amount_gathered}\")\n        \n        if harvested == 0:\n            print(f\"Resource patch depleted, searching for next {resource} patch\")\n        \n        attempts += 1\n\n    assert amount_gathered >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to gather enough {resource} after {max_attempts} attempts.
