  "objective": "create a self fueling coal mining system using burner inserters and transport belts",
  "steps": "To create a self-fueling coal mining system using burner inserters and transport belts in Factorio, you can follow this plan:\n\n1. Find a coal patch: Locate a suitable coal deposit to start your mining operation.\n\n2. Place burner mining drills: Position several burner mining drills directly on the coal patch. These will mine the coal without requiring electricity.\n\n3. Set up burner inserters: Place burner inserters next to each burner mining drill. Configure them to take coal from the mining drill's output and insert it back into the drill's fuel slot. This creates a self-fueling loop for the mining drills.\n\n4. Create a coal collection system:\n   a. Place transport belts in front of the burner mining drills to collect the excess coal not used for fueling.\n   b. Arrange the belts to form a main line that collects coal from all the drills.\n\n5. Add additional burner inserters: Place burner inserters along the transport belt line to keep it running. Configure these inserters to:\n   a. Pick up coal from the belt.\n   b. Insert coal into their own fuel slots.\n   c. Place excess coal back onto the belt.\n\n6. Create a coal storage area: At the end of your belt line, set up some wooden chests or steel chests to store the excess coal for later use.\n\n7. Optimization:\n   a. Ensure that the burner inserters feeding the mining drills have priority over those feeding the belt system.\n   b. Consider creating loops or branches in your belt system to maximize coal distribution.\n\n8. Expansion: As you gather more resources, gradually replace burner inserters with electric inserters and add more mining drills to increase production.\n\nThis system will continuously mine coal, use some to fuel itself, and output excess coal for other uses in your factory. It's an excellent starting point for early-game power generation and resource gathering in Factorio.",
