        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `resource_type` in the loop is a tuple, not an object with a `name` attribute. This is due to how the `resources_needed` list is defined. The `Resource` enum items are likely tuples themselves, so when we iterate over `resources_needed`, we're getting tuples, not enum objects.\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust how we're accessing the resource type and how we're checking the inventory. We should use the first element of the tuple (which is likely the string name of the resource) to check the inventory.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Define the resources needed\nresources_needed = [(Resource.IronOre, 31), (Resource.Coal, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type we need to gather\nfor resource_type, quantity_required in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest location for this resource\n    resource_location = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to that location to start mining\n    move_to(resource_location)\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of this resource\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(resource_location, quantity_required)\n    \n    # Log how much was harvested for verification purposes\n    print(f\"Harvested {harvested_quantity} of {resource_type[0]}.\")\n    \n    # Verify if enough has been mined by checking current inventory state\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    actual_quantity_in_inventory = current_inventory[resource_type]\n   \n    assert actual_quantity_in_inventory >= quantity_required,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type[0]}.

We're now using `resource_type[0]` when we need the string name of the resource for printing.\n2. We're using `current_inventory[resource_type]` to get the quantity from the inventory, which should work correctly with the `Resource` enum.\n3. I've added final assertions to double-check that we have the required amounts of iron ore and coal in our inventory after all the gathering is done.\n\nThese changes should resolve the AttributeError and allow the script to run successfully."

We also need coal to fuel the furnace for smelting. There's already a stone furnace on the map, so we don't need to craft one.\n\nGiven that our inventory is empty, we need to gather all the necessary resources from scratch. We'll need to mine iron ore and coal, smelt the iron ore into plates, and then craft the required components before finally crafting the SteamEngine.\n\nHere's the detailed plan:\n\n###START OF PLAN\nSTEP 1: Gather resources\n- Mine at least 31 iron ore\n- Mine at least 10 coal (for fueling the furnace)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 31 iron ore and 10 coal in our inventory\n\nSTEP 2: Prepare the furnace\n- Move to the existing stone furnace at position (-12.0, -12.0)\n- Add coal to the furnace as fuel\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that the furnace status changes from NO_FUEL to IDLE\n\nSTEP 3: Smelt iron plates\n- Add iron ore to the furnace\n- Wait for the smelting process to complete (31 cycles)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 31 iron plates in our inventory\n\nSTEP 4: Craft iron gear wheels\n- Craft 8 iron gear wheels (each requires 2 iron plates)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have 8 iron gear wheels in our inventory\n\nSTEP 5: Craft pipes\n- Craft 5 pipes (each requires 1 iron plate)\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have 5 pipes in our inventory\n\nSTEP 6: Craft the SteamEngine\n- Use 8 iron gear wheels, 10 iron plates, and 5 pipes to craft 1 SteamEngine\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have 1 SteamEngine in our inventory\n\n###END OF PLAN",
