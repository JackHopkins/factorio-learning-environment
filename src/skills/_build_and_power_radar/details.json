  "objective": "Build a radar and power it to start revealing the surrounding area",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective \"Build a radar and power it to start revealing the surrounding area\" in Factorio, follow these steps:\n\n1. Gather necessary resources:\n   - Iron plates\n   - Copper plates\n   - Steel plates\n   - Electronic circuits\n\n2. Craft a radar:\n   - Open the crafting menu\n   - Find the radar recipe\n   - Craft one radar (typically requires iron plates, gears, and electronic circuits)\n\n3. Choose a suitable location:\n   - Select an open area with space for the radar and power supply\n   - Ideally, place it at the edge of your current visible area to maximize new area revealed\n\n4. Place the radar:\n   - Select the radar from your inventory\n   - Click to place it on the chosen location\n\n5. Set up power generation (if not already available):\n   - Build a steam engine setup (boiler + steam engine + offshore pump) or\n   - Set up solar panels with accumulators\n\n6. Connect the radar to the power grid:\n   - Use small or medium electric poles to connect the radar to your power source\n   - Ensure the power line reaches from your power generation to the radar\n\n7. Verify operation:\n   - Check that the radar has power (you should see it rotating)\n   - Open the map view to see the radar slowly revealing the surrounding area in sectors\n\n8. Optionally, build additional radars:\n   - For faster and wider area revelation, consider building more radars in different locations\n\nBy following these steps, you'll successfully build and power a radar, which will start revealing the surrounding area on your Factorio map.",
