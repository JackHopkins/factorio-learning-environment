Main Objective: We need to set up coal transport from a chest to a furnace. The final setup should be checked by looking if the furnace where we sent coal to is fueled
"""



"""
Step 1: Place inserters. We need to place two burner inserters, one near the chest and one near the furnace. The substeps are:
- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5) and place a burner inserter next to it
- Rotate the inserter to take items from the chest
- Move to the furnace at (5.0, 0.0) and place a burner inserter next to it
- Rotate the inserter to put items into the furnace
- Fuel both inserters with coal from the chest

Step 2: Connect with transport belts. We need to connect the two inserters using transport belts. The substeps are:
- Start at the chest inserter's drop position
- Place transport belts to connect to the furnace inserter's pickup position
- Ensure the belt direction is correct (from chest to furnace)

"""
Step 3: Verify the setup. We need to check if the coal is being transported and the furnace is fueled. The substeps are:
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow time for coal transport
- Check if the furnace at (5.0, 0.0) has coal in its fuel inventory
