  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nPlace 5 transport belts to create a simple conveyor system.\n\nThis objective introduces the player to the concept of automation and logistics in Factorio by having them place transport belts. It's a single, clear task that's different from the previous objectives and helps players understand a fundamental mechanic of the game.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of placing 5 transport belts to create a simple conveyor system in Factorio, I would recommend the following plan:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Ensure you have enough iron plates to craft transport belts. Each transport belt requires 1 iron gear wheel and 1 iron plate.\n   - If needed, mine some iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\n\n2. Craft transport belts:\n   - Open the crafting menu.\n   - Locate the transport belt recipe.\n   - Craft at least 5 transport belts.\n\n3. Choose a suitable location:\n   - Find a clear, flat area where you want to place your conveyor system.\n   - Consider placing it near your current production area or resources for future use.\n\n4. Place the transport belts:\n   - Select the transport belts from your inventory.\n   - Click and drag to place 5 transport belts in a straight line or in the desired configuration.\n   - Remember that transport belts have a direction, so make sure they're all facing the same way for continuous movement.\n\n5. Test the system:\n   - Place an item on one end of the belt to ensure it moves along the conveyor system.\n\n6. Optional: Enhance the system\n   - If desired, add input and output containers at the ends of the belt.\n   - Consider creating a loop or adding splits in the belt system to demonstrate more complex logistics.\n\nThis plan introduces the player to basic automation and logistics concepts while keeping the task simple and achievable. It sets the foundation for more complex belt systems and automated production lines in future objectives.",
