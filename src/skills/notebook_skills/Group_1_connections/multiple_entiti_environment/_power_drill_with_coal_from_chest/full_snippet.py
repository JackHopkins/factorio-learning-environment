Main Objective: We need to set up coal transport from a chest to a drill. The final setup should be checked by looking if the drill where we sent coal to is fueled
"""



"""
Step 1: Set up coal extraction from the chest. We need to:
- Move to the chest at (5.5, -4.5)
- Place a burner inserter next to the chest
- Rotate the inserter to take coal from the chest
- Fuel the inserter with coal from the chest

"""
Step 2: Create transport belt line. We need to:
- Start placing transport belts from the inserter's drop position towards the drill at (20.0, 20.0)
- Continue placing belts until we reach next to the drill

"""
Step 3: Set up coal insertion into the drill. We need to:
- Move to the drill at (20.0, 20.0)
- Place a burner inserter next to the drill
- Rotate the inserter to put coal into the drill
- Fuel the inserter with coal from the transport belt

"""
Step 4: Connect the transport system. We need to:
- Ensure the transport belt line connects the drop position of the chest inserter to the pickup position of the drill inserter
"""
# Placeholder 4

"""
Step 5: Verify the setup. We need to:
- Wait for 30 seconds to allow coal to be transported
- Check if the burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) has fuel in it
