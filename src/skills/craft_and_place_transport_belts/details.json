  "objective": "Here's a new, single-task objective for the Factorio curriculum:\n\nCraft and place 5 transport belts to move items automatically.\n\nThis objective introduces the player to the concept of automation, which is a core mechanic in Factorio. It's different from the previous examples as it focuses on crafting and using a specific item for logistics, rather than resource gathering or basic crafting.",
  "steps": "To achieve the objective of crafting and placing 5 transport belts in Factorio, I would recommend the following plan:\n\n1. Gather resources:\n   - Mine iron ore (you'll need at least 7.5 iron ore)\n   - Collect wood (you'll need at least 5 wood)\n\n2. Craft intermediate items:\n   - Smelt the iron ore into iron plates (7.5 iron ore will produce 7.5 iron plates)\n   - Craft 5 iron gears (each requires 2 iron plates, so you'll use 5 iron plates in total)\n\n3. Craft transport belts:\n   - Open the crafting menu\n   - Select the transport belt recipe (each belt requires 1 iron gear and 1 iron plate)\n   - Craft 5 transport belts\n\n4. Place the transport belts:\n   - Select the transport belts from your inventory\n   - Choose a suitable location for your first automated system\n   - Place the 5 transport belts in a line or curve, depending on your needs\n   - Ensure the arrows on the belts are pointing in the direction you want items to move\n\n5. Test the system:\n   - Place some items (like iron plates or copper ore) on one end of the belt\n   - Observe the items moving along the transport belt automatically\n\n6. Optional: Enhance the system\n   - Consider adding an input (like a mining drill) at the start of the belt\n   - Add an output (like a chest or assembling machine) at the end of the belt\n\nThis plan introduces the player to the basic concept of automation and logistics in Factorio, setting the foundation for more complex systems later in the game.",
