  "steps": "To create a self-fueling coal mining system in Factorio, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a coal deposit: Locate a suitable coal patch to set up your mining operation.\n\n2. Place electric mining drills: Position several electric mining drills on the coal deposit. Make sure they cover as much of the coal patch as possible.\n\n3. Set up power: Place steam engines and boilers near a water source to generate electricity for your mining drills. Initially, you'll need to manually fuel these with coal.\n\n4. Create a transportation system: Use a series of transport belts to move the mined coal from the drills to your power generation area.\n\n5. Automate fuel input: Set up inserters to automatically feed coal from the transport belts into the boilers.\n\n6. Power distribution: Connect your steam engines to power poles and extend the electricity network to reach your mining drills.\n\n7. Closed-loop system: Ensure that some of the mined coal is directed back to fuel the mining operation itself. This creates a self-sustaining loop.\n\n8. Buffer storage: Add some wooden chests or steel chests along the belt line to store excess coal, which can be used for other purposes or as a buffer during consumption spikes.\n\n9. Optimize and expand: As you progress, upgrade to more efficient miners, faster belts, and potentially switch to electric furnaces for smelting operations nearby.\n\n10. Maintenance: Periodically check on the system to ensure it's running smoothly and expand as needed when the coal patch depletes.\n\nThis setup will create a self-fueling coal mining system that provides a steady supply of coal for your power needs and other coal-consuming processes in your factory.",
