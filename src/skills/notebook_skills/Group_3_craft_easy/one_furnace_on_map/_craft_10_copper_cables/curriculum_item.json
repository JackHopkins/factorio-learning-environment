        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather raw resources, specifically coal and copper ore.\n2. **Coal Gathering**:\n   - Locate the nearest coal patch using the `nearest` function for `Resource.Coal`.\n   - Move to this location using `move_to`.\n   - Harvest at least 10 units of coal using `harvest_resource`.\n3. **Copper Ore Gathering**:\n   - Locate the nearest copper ore patch using the `nearest` function for `Resource.CopperOre`.\n   - Move to this location.\n   - Harvest at least 10 units of copper ore.\n4. **Verification**:\n   - After gathering both resources, verify that we have at least 10 units of each in our inventory by inspecting it.\n\nNow, let's implement these steps in code:\n\n```python\n# Define the required resources and amounts\nresources_needed = [(Resource.Coal, 10), (Resource.CopperOre, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and amount needed\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Log moving action\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {resource_position}\")\n    \n    # Move to the resource's position\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    # Log harvesting action\n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} of {resource_type}\")\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of resource from that position\n    harvest_resource(resource_position, amount=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we have gathered enough resources by inspecting inventory\n    current_amount = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    # Assert that we have collected at least as much as needed for this step\n    assert current_amount >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to collect enough {resource_type}.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `harvest_resource` function does not accept an `amount` parameter as a keyword argument.

Instead, we should use `quantity` as the parameter name.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for Placeholder 1:\n\n```python\n# Define the required resources and amounts\nresources_needed = [(Resource.Coal, 10), (Resource.CopperOre, 10)]\n\n# Loop through each resource type and amount needed\nfor resource_type, amount_needed in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest position of the current resource type\n    resource_position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {resource_position}\")\n    move_to(resource_position)\n    \n    print(f\"Harvesting {amount_needed} of {resource_type}\")\n    \n    # Harvest the specified amount of resource from that position\n    # Use 'quantity' instead of 'amount'\n    harvested = harvest_resource(resource_position, quantity=amount_needed)\n    \n    # Check if we have gathered enough resources by inspecting inventory\n    current_amount = inspect_inventory().get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    # Assert that we have collected at least as much as needed for this step\n    assert current_amount >= amount_needed, f\"Failed to collect enough {resource_type}.

We'll need to mine coal for fuel and copper ore for smelting. Since our inventory is empty, we'll need to craft everything from scratch.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to achieve the objective:\n\n###START OF PLAN\n\nSTEP 1: Gather raw resources\n- Move to the nearest coal patch and mine at least 10 coal\n- Move to the nearest copper ore patch and mine at least 10 copper ore\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 10 coal and 10 copper ore in the inventory\n\nSTEP 2: Fuel and use the existing furnace\n- Move to the stone furnace at position (-12.0, -12.0)\n- Add coal to the furnace as fuel\n- Add copper ore to the furnace for smelting\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that the furnace is operational (has fuel and ingredients)\n\nSTEP 3: Collect smelted copper plates\n- Wait for the furnace to smelt the copper ore into copper plates\n- Collect the copper plates from the furnace\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 5 copper plates in the inventory\n\nSTEP 4: Craft copper cables\n- Use the crafting menu to craft copper cables (2 copper cables per 1 copper plate)\n- Craft until we have at least 10 copper cables\nOUTPUT CHECK: Verify that we have at least 10 copper cables in the inventory\n\n###END OF PLAN",
