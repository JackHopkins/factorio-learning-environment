        "PLANNING STAGE\n\n1. **Objective**: We need to gather raw resources, specifically iron ore, copper ore, and coal. The quantities required are at least 23 iron ore, 5 copper ore, and 10 coal.\n\n2. **Approach**:\n   - Use the `nearest()` function to find the closest resource patches for each type of resource.\n   - Move to each resource location using `move_to()`.\n   - Harvest the required amount of each resource using `harvest_resource()`.\n   - After harvesting each type of resource, verify that we have gathered enough by checking our inventory with `inspect_inventory()`.\n\n3. **Verification**:\n   - For each type of resource mined (iron ore, copper ore, coal), assert that the quantity in inventory meets or exceeds the required amount.\n\n4. **Assumptions**:\n   - There are accessible patches for iron ore, copper ore, and coal within a reasonable distance.\n   - Inventory starts empty as per given data.\n\nLet's implement this plan in code:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed and their quantities\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.IronOre, 23),\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 5),\n    (Resource.Coal, 10)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource requirement\nfor resource_type, required_amount in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest patch of this resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the location of this resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {position}...\")\n    move_to(position)\n\n    # Harvest the required amount plus some extra for inefficiencies\n    harvest_amount = int(required_amount * 1.2)  # Adding a buffer for safety\n    print(f\"Harvesting {harvest_amount} units of {resource_type}...\")\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(position=position, quantity=harvest_amount)\n\n    # Check if we have enough in our inventory after harvesting\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    actual_quantity = current_inventory.get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n    \n    assert actual_quantity >= required_amount,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}. Expected at least {required_amount}, but got {actual_quantity}\"\n    \n    print(f\"Successfully gathered sufficient {resource_type}: {actual_quantity}\")\n```\n\nThis code will ensure that we gather all necessary raw materials while providing detailed logs on what is happening during execution. It also includes assertions to confirm successful completion before moving on to subsequent steps in your script.",
        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because we're trying to access the 'value' attribute of the Resource enum, which doesn't exist. The Resource enum is likely defined differently than we expected. Instead of having a 'value' attribute, it seems to be a tuple itself.\n\nThe line causing the error is:\n```python\nactual_quantity = current_inventory.get(resource_type.value[0], 0)\n```\n\nWe need to modify this to directly use the resource_type as the key for the inventory dictionary, without trying to access a 'value' attribute.\n\nAdditionally, we should ensure that we're using the correct method to check the inventory. The `inspect_inventory()` function returns an Inventory object, which might have a different interface than a regular dictionary.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\nHere's the corrected code for the placeholder:\n\n```python\n# Define the resources needed and their quantities\nresources_needed = [\n    (Resource.IronOre, 23),\n    (Resource.CopperOre, 5),\n    (Resource.Coal, 10)\n]\n\n# Loop through each resource requirement\nfor resource_type, required_amount in resources_needed:\n    # Find the nearest patch of this resource\n    print(f\"Finding nearest {resource_type}...\")\n    position = nearest(resource_type)\n    \n    # Move to the location of this resource\n    print(f\"Moving to {resource_type} at position {position}...\")\n    move_to(position)\n\n    # Harvest the required amount plus some extra for inefficiencies\n    harvest_amount = int(required_amount * 1.2)  # Adding a buffer for safety\n    print(f\"Harvesting {harvest_amount} units of {resource_type}...\")\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(position=position, quantity=harvest_amount)\n\n    # Check if we have enough in our inventory after harvesting\n    current_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    actual_quantity = current_inventory[resource_type]\n    \n    assert actual_quantity >= required_amount,\\\n        f\"Failed to gather enough {resource_type}.

This suggests that the `resource_type` variable is a tuple instead of an enum or object with a 'value' attribute as expected.\n\nThe error is likely caused by how the Resource enum is defined or how it's being used.

Defines the resources we need to gather as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the Resource enum and the required quantity.\n2. Loops through each resource, finds its nearest location, moves to it, and harvests it.\n3. Checks the inventory after each harvest to ensure we've gathered enough.\n4.
