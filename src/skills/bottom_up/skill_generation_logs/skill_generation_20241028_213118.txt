[2024-10-28 21:31:18] Base skills selected:
[2024-10-28 21:31:18]   - test_defence: Tests the creation and deployment of an automated defense system by: 1) harvesting required resources (iron ore, copper ore, coal), 2) crafting intermediate components (iron plates, copper plates, gears), 3) manufacturing defensive equipment (gun turrets and ammunition), and 4) establishing a defensive line by placing turrets and supplying them with ammo. Verifies proper resource gathering, manufacturing, placement and ammunition distribution through assertions.
[2024-10-28 21:31:18]   - test_build_iron_plate_factory: Tests construction of an automated iron smelting factory by placing mining drills, transport belts, inserters and furnaces in the correct configuration. Places burner drills to mine iron ore, connects them via belts and inserters to stone furnaces, adds coal mining and delivery infrastructure, and routes finished iron plates to an output chest. Validates that all components are properly positioned and connected to create a working production line.

[2024-10-28 21:31:22] Generated objective: Implement a snippet that creates an automated ammunition production line by combining mining operations for raw materials (iron/copper ore, coal), smelting infrastructure for metal plates, and assembly machines to craft magazines - then automatically distribute the ammunition to a network of defensive turrets using inserters and transport belts. Verify the complete production chain from resource extraction to turret supply is functioning correctly.
