Instead, we should use the `resource_type.name` to get the string representation of the resource.\n\nAdditionally, there are a few other improvements we can make:\n1. We should use `Prototype` instead of `Resource` for consistency with the `inspect_inventory()` method.\n2. We don't need to check the inventory after harvesting, as the `harvest_resource()` function returns the amount harvested.\n3.
