        "To achieve this step, we need to smelt iron ore and copper ore into their respective plates using the stone furnaces that have been set up. We already have two stone furnaces placed on the map, each fueled with coal. The current inventory has 9 iron ores and 15 copper ores that we need to insert into these furnaces for smelting.\n\nPLANNING STAGE:\n1. **Insert Iron Ore into Furnace 1**: \n   - Use one of the available stone furnaces (let's use `furnace2` which is at position x=-14.0, y=-12.0) to smelt iron ore.\n   - Insert all 9 iron ores from the inventory into this furnace.\n\n2. **Insert Copper Ore into Furnace 2**:\n   - Use the other stone furnace (`furnace1` which is at position x=-10.0, y=-12.0) to smelt copper ore.\n   - Insert all 15 copper ores from the inventory into this furnace.\n\n3. **Wait for Smelting Process**:\n   - Each piece of ore takes about 0.7 seconds to smelt in a stone furnace.\n   - Wait for an appropriate amount of time based on the number of ores being processed in each furnace.\n\n4. **Extract Smelted Plates**:\n   - Extract the resulting iron plates from `furnace2`.\n   - Extract the resulting copper plates from `furnace1`.\n\n5. **Verify Inventory**:\n   - Check if our final inventory contains at least 9 iron plates and 15 copper plates after extraction.\n\nNow let's write code following this plan:\n\n```python\n# Get reference to both furnaces\nstone_furnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nassert len(stone_furnaces) >= 2, \"Expected at least two Stone Furnaces on map\"\n\n# Assigning specific roles to each furnace\niron_furnace = next(f for f in stone_furnaces if f.position == Position(x=-14.0, y=-12.0))\ncopper_furnace = next(f for f in stone_furnaces if f.position == Position(x=-10.0, y=-12.0))\n\n# Insert Iron Ore into Furnace dedicated for Iron Plates\nprint(\"Inserting Iron Ore into Furnace dedicated for Iron Plates\")\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, iron_furnace, quantity=9)\n\n# Insert Copper Ore into Furnace dedicated for Copper Plates\nprint(\"Inserting Copper Ore into Furnace dedicated for Copper Plates\")\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, copper_furnace, quantity=15)\n\n# Calculate total waiting time needed based on maximum number of items being smelted concurrently\ntotal_wait_time = max(9 * 0.7, 15 * 0.7)\nprint(f\"Waiting {total_wait_time} seconds for smelting process to complete...\")\nsleep(total_wait_time)\n\n# Extract Smelted Iron Plates from corresponding Furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, iron_furnace.position, quantity=9)\nprint(\"Extracted Iron Plates\")\n\n# Extract Smelted Copper Plates from corresponding Furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, copper_furnace.position, quantity=15)\nprint(\"Extracted Copper Plates\")\n\n# Verify success by checking updated inventory counts\ninventory_after_smelting = inspect_inventory()\nassert inventory_after_smelting.get(Prototype.IronPlate) >= 9,\\\n    f\"Failed to obtain enough Iron Plates; expected at least 9 but got {inventory_after_smelting.get(Prototype.IronPlate)}\"\nassert inventory_after_smelting.get(Prototype.CopperPlate) >= 15,\\\n    f\"Failed to obtain enough Copper Plates; expected at least 15 but got {inventory_after_smelting.get(Prototype.CopperPlate)}\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully completed smelting operation.\")\n```\n\nThis code ensures that both types of ores are inserted correctly and extracted once they are converted into their plate forms while verifying through assertions that we achieved our target outputs successfully in terms of quantities required per type (iron/copper)."
