Checks for exactly 3 stone furnaces.\n3. Verifies that we still have our 5 coal.\n4. Ensures we don't have any stone left.\n5.

        "#ERROR ANALYSIS\nThe error occurs because the `Inventory` object does not have a `values()` method. This is likely because the `Inventory` class is a custom implementation that doesn't inherit from Python's built-in dictionary class. \n\nThe attempt tried to use the `values()` method, which is typically available for Python dictionaries, but not for this custom `Inventory` class. Instead, we need to use the methods and attributes that are specifically available for the `Inventory` class.\n\nFrom the API documentation and previous examples, we can see that we can access inventory items using square bracket notation, like `inventory[Prototype.StoneFurnace]`. We should use this method to check for the presence and quantity of stone furnaces in the inventory.\n\n#ERROR CORRECTION\n```python\n# Verify success.

It asserts that we have exactly 3 stone furnaces, raising an error if this condition is not met.\n4. If the assertion passes, it prints a success message along with the count of stone furnaces.\n5. Finally, it prints the entire inventory for verification.\n\nThis approach avoids using the `values()` method and instead directly accesses the count of stone furnaces in the inventory, which should work with the custom `Inventory` class."
