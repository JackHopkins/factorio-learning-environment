Step 1: Print recipes. We need to print the recipes for the following items:
- Electronic Circuit
- Copper Cable
- Stone Furnace
- Burner Mining Drill

"""
Step 2: Gather resources. We need to gather the following resources:
- Stone for crafting a stone furnace
- Coal for fuel
- Copper ore for smelting into copper plates
"""
# Placeholder 2

"""
Step 3: Craft stone furnace. We need to craft a stone furnace for smelting ores.
"""
# Placeholder 3

"""
Step 4: Smelt iron plates. We need to smelt the iron ore from the chest into iron plates:
- Move to the chest and collect the iron ore
- Place the stone furnace
- Fuel the furnace with coal
- Smelt the 11 iron ore into iron plates
"""
# Placeholder 4

"""
Step 5: Craft burner mining drill. We need to craft a burner mining drill to mine copper ore efficiently:
- Use the iron plates to craft the burner mining drill
"""
# Placeholder 5

"""
Step 6: Mine copper ore. We need to mine copper ore:
- Move to a copper ore patch
- Place the burner mining drill
- Fuel the burner mining drill with coal
- Collect the mined copper ore
"""
# Placeholder 6

"""
Step 7: Smelt copper plates. We need to smelt the copper ore into copper plates:
- Move the stone furnace near the copper mining setup
- Fuel the furnace with coal
- Smelt the copper ore into copper plates
"""
# Placeholder 7

"""
Step 8: Craft copper cables. We need to craft 21 copper cables:
- Use 11 copper plates to craft 22 copper cables (we'll have one extra)
"""
# Placeholder 8

"""
Step 9: Craft electronic circuits. We need to craft 7 electronic circuits:
- Use 21 copper cables and 7 iron plates to craft 7 electronic circuits
"""
# Placeholder 9

"""
Step 10: Verify success. Check the inventory to ensure we have 7 electronic circuits.
